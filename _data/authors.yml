imogen:
    name: "Imogen Wegman"
    bio: "Having grown up in Hobart, Imogen has a strong connection to her island home. She completed her undergraduate studies at the University of Tasmania, before moving to the UK to join the University of East Anglia’s Landscape History MA program. She returned to Tasmania to complete her PhD in History at the University of Tasmania, examining the differences between land grants given to convicts and free settlers. Her research continues to interrogate colonial landscapes, using digital tools such as GIS (mapping) to understand the relationships between people and the land. Imogen is now a lecturer in history at the University of Tasmania, teaching into the Diploma of Family History and the Bachelor of Arts. She continues to nerd out about maps with her students, teaching them how to find and interpret them for their own research. Imogen has a keen interest in public histories, and has held a range of non-academic roles that have connected her research with the public – tour guide, client services officer in a reference library, and a writer for a genealogical company. In 2016 she co-founded a monthly pub-based history event in Hobart, A Pint of History, and continues to find ways to bring her enthusiasm about history to school students, locals and anyone else who will listen."
