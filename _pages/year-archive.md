These various posts have been composed by our wonderful AAPHN members on topics ranging from public history in Australia and Aotearoa NZ, to information about upcoming events or previous projects. If you would like to contribute to the AAPHN blog please send through a short (~150 word) description of your proposed post to <arts.CAH@mq.edu.au> and we will inform you of the rest of the submission process. We are accepting entries from all members of our network on any topic to do with public history.
