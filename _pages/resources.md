* Kalimpong Kids
: **Description**: Between 1908 and 1938, 130 Anglo-Indian adolescents were sent to New Zealand from Dr Graham’s Homes in Kalimpong, India. Most were the children of British tea planters and Indian women, and faced an uncertain future in India. Their resettlement in New Zealand was in many ways a success, but it was also characterised by silence about their heritage.
: This website is for descendants of the Kalimpong Kids, many of whom are still discovering this hidden aspect of their family history. It is also for anyone with an interest in the Kalimpong story, from which we can learn so much about memory, community and family ties.

### Scholarships

* History, heritage and environmental change in a deindustrialised landscape
: **Description**:
: The project’s multi-disciplinary historical and archaeological project team is seeking expressions of interest from suitable candidates for a HDR Scholarship to participate in the investigation of the forgotten shale-mining settlements that existed in the environmentally and culturally significant Jamison and Megalong Valleys in the Blue Mountains during the final decades of the 19th and early decades of the 20th centuries.
: The research centres on the collection of archaeological, archival, and oral history evidence to identify dimensions of everyday working and family life, task scapes, and migration linked to shale mining work, community and gender. The project includes a creative applied dimension that aims to produce educational and social outcomes, such as memory scapes, a walking tour and teaching materials that can contribute to conservation and interpretation of industrial heritage and cultural heritage tourism.  In this way, the project aims to advance knowledge and enable cross-generational engagement with history and heritage to improve understanding of the long-term impact of deindustrialisation through collaborative and multidisciplinary, scholarly, and community-based study with industry partners: the Blue Mountains World Heritage Institute, NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service, MTS Heritage, Lantern Heritage.
