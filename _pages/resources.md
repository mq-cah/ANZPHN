* **Kalimpong Kids**
: **Description**: Between 1908 and 1938, 130 Anglo-Indian adolescents were sent to New Zealand from Dr Graham’s Homes in Kalimpong, India. Most were the children of British tea planters and Indian women, and faced an uncertain future in India. Their resettlement in New Zealand was in many ways a success, but it was also characterised by silence about their heritage.
: This website is for descendants of the Kalimpong Kids, many of whom are still discovering this hidden aspect of their family history. It is also for anyone with an interest in the Kalimpong story, from which we can learn so much about memory, community and family ties.

## Funding and Research Opportunities

### Postgraduate Study
#### Open
* Co-tutelle PhD Opportunity with Macquarie University and the University of Bristol: 2022-2025
 : **Description**:
 : Professor Hilary Carey and Associate Professor Tanya Evans are hoping to recruit a funded co-tutelle PhD student to work on colonial history to be based at the University of Bristol for the first 2 years of the project and at Macquarie University for the final 2 years of the project.
 : **The Project**:
 : The award is open to students embarking on PhD research starting in October 2022 in any aspect of British and Australian colonial history. We are looking for applicants interested in pursuing original research to be supervised by Professor Hilary Carey (University of Bristol) and Associate Professor Tanya Evans (Macquarie University) who are leading historians of colonialism and its legacies in the British world. The studentship is funded through the Bristol-Macquarie Cotutelle Programme which offers postgraduate researchers access to state of the art facilities at two universities. The programme encourages and facilitates comparative studies based in the UK and Australia. Possible doctoral projects could include, but will not be restricted to: public histories of colonialism, heritage and the built environment in colonial cities, religious and cultural colonialism in settler societies, legacies of colonialism in old and new worlds, diasporic identities in old and new societies. The research contexts for this work could include (but are not restricted to) modern Australian and British (including Irish) history, colonial history, or global history. It is expected that the project would require experience working in archives. The project will take place over four years and involve complementary research in imperial and colonial sites in the UK and Australia. As a condition of funding, the successful applicant will study for the first two years on location at the University of Bristol. The final two years will be spent on location at Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia. Alongside their research, the student will help with aspects of public engagement coordinated by the supervisors.
: **Application**: Please apply in writing to <hilary.carey@bristol.ac.uk>, with a formal research proposal, cv, and a statement (no more than 1 page) of your suitability for a role that combines academic research with public engagement. The student must be eligible for UK home fees (or pay the difference for international students). **Must start in the UK 1st Oct 2022.**
: **Closing date**: 1st August 2022.
