## Web resources
These categories of resources overlap, but if you would like your resource put under another heading, do please get in touch at <aaphn@mq.edu.au>.

### Research Tools
* **GLAM Workbench**
: "Here you’ll find a collection of tools, tutorials, examples, and hacks to help you work with data from galleries, libraries, archives, and museums (the GLAM sector). The primary focus is Australia and New Zealand, but new collections are being added all the time. Let me know if there’s some GLAM data you’d like me to explore – suggestions are always welcome!" T. Sherratt
: <https://glam-workbench.net/>{:target="_blank"}
* **Time Layered Cultural Map**
: This resource provides tools to help humanities researchers, including historians, and anyone interested in history, to work with digital maps. Many more history datasets will be added to this resource over the coming year.

* **Trove**
: Trove is a collaboration between the National Library of Australia and hundreds of Partner organisations around Australia.
: <https://trove.nla.gov.au/>{:target="_blank"}
* **Trove Newspapers: Data Dashboard**
: Trove's collection of digitised newspapers is always changing – new articles and newspapers are being added by the NLA, while Trove users are busy correcting OCRd text and adding tags and comments. The search you run today might produce different results than the same query did a month ago, a year ago, or ten years ago. Researchers need to understand how these changes affect the queries they make, the results they find, and the arguments they construct. This dashboard helps researchers understand the context of their queries by presenting a snapshot of Trove's digitised newspapers, based on weekly data harvests. It shows Trove's current make up from a number of angles, as well as highlighting recent changes. It is updated every Sunday.

Their resettlement in New Zealand was in many ways a success, but it was also characterised by silence about their heritage.

**Closed**
* Co-tutelle PhD Opportunity with Macquarie University and the University of Bristol: 2022-2025
 : **Description**:
 : Professor Hilary Carey and Associate Professor Tanya Evans are hoping to recruit a funded co-tutelle PhD student to work on colonial history to be based at the University of Bristol for the first 2 years of the project and at Macquarie University for the final 2 years of the project.
 : **The Project**:
 : The award is open to students embarking on PhD research starting in October 2022 in any aspect of British and Australian colonial history. We are looking for applicants interested in pursuing original research to be supervised by Professor Hilary Carey (University of Bristol) and Associate Professor Tanya Evans (Macquarie University) who are leading historians of colonialism and its legacies in the British world. The studentship is funded through the Bristol-Macquarie Cotutelle Programme which offers postgraduate researchers access to state of the art facilities at two universities. The programme encourages and facilitates comparative studies based in the UK and Australia. Possible doctoral projects could include, but will not be restricted to: public histories of colonialism, heritage and the built environment in colonial cities, religious and cultural colonialism in settler societies, legacies of colonialism in old and new worlds, diasporic identities in old and new societies. The research contexts for this work could include (but are not restricted to) modern Australian and British (including Irish) history, colonial history, or global history. It is expected that the project would require experience working in archives. The project will take place over four years and involve complementary research in imperial and colonial sites in the UK and Australia. As a condition of funding, the successful applicant will study for the first two years on location at the University of Bristol. The final two years will be spent on location at Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia. Alongside their research, the student will help with aspects of public engagement coordinated by the supervisors.
: **Application**: Please apply in writing to <hilary.carey@bristol.ac.uk>, with a formal research proposal, cv, and a statement (no more than 1 page) of your suitability for a role that combines academic research with public engagement.
