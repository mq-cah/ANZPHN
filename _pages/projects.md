**Crises of Leadership in the Eastern Roman Empire (250-1000 CE)**
: **Project Description** In 250 CE, after Rome was defeated in the Persian wars, the Roman empire seemed on the brink of destruction. By 1000 CE it had collapsed, due to multiple crises including: waves of mass migration, increasing demands for Roman citizenship, populism in government, religious extremism and food shortages due to war and climate change. These crises arose from complex problems that required strong and strategic leadership. There is a convergence between the challenges faced by Roman leaders then and those facing our leaders today.

**Historians at the Movies (HATM)**
: **Project Description** Historians at the Movies Australia, or HATMAus, is an occasional live watch party on Twitter. Hosted by Dr Joel Barnes and Dr Chelsea Barnett, we watch a film and live-tweet our way through, using the hashtag #HATMAus. Born at the beginning of COVID-19 lockdown as a way to maintain connection and conversation, #HATMAus has transformed into a community of film lovers and friends. We historicise, we talk, we share memories, insights, and gifs. Best of all, we welcome everyone, historians and non-historians alike!Â

## Q-T
**'Slow' digitisation, community heritage and the objects of Martindale Hall**
: **Project Description** This project aims to investigate how community history, heritage, and cultural collections can be better preserved and made accessible through slow digitisation techniques. The project will generate new interdisciplinary knowledge about Martindale Hall, SA, the historically significant objects it contains, and digitisation. Expected outcomes include a new method that embeds digitisation in historical and cultural knowledge, and assists organisations to make sustainable decisions about when and how to digitise. Benefits include improved public access to significant cultural heritage assets, return on investment for local history organisations, and protection of cultural heritage places and objects by the communities that care for them.
