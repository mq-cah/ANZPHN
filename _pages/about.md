## The AANZPHN
The aim of the *Australian and Aotearoa New Zealand Public History Network* is to develop public history across Australasia by creating opportunities to communicate, meet and share knowledge among individuals and organisations who practice public and applied history in the academy, communities, industry and professions. We aim to promote teaching, research and engagements between these diverse communities and encourage best practice through an online portal.

There are a number of history organisations across Australia such as *[Museums Australia](https://www.amaga.org.au/)*, *[Australian Historical Association](https://www.theaha.org.au/)*, the several *Professional Historians Associations*, *[History Council of NSW](https://historycouncilnsw.org.au/)*, several *Family and Local Historical Societies* (some helpfully listed by the [National Library](https://www.nla.gov.au/research-guides/family-history/family-history-societies)), Heritage Councils, *[AIATSIS](https://aiatsis.gov.au/)*, the several State and Territory *[History Teachers Associations](http://www.historyteacher.org.au/)*, *[Oral History Australia](https://oralhistoryaustralia.org.au/)* and the *[Federation of Australian Historical Societies](https://www.history.org.au/)*. However, members of these groups who understand themselves as public historians donâ€™t always communicate effectively with each other about public history. This network will encourage national and international communication and collaboration at a time when we need to emphasise the cultural and social benefits of public history learning, teaching and community engagement for everyone.
