## Upcoming Events
### History Weeks
**History Week (NSW) 2022**
: **Event Description**: History Week is the annual, state-wide celebration of History organised by the History Council of New South Wales. Initiated by the HCNSW in 1997, History Week is a fantastic opportunity for member organisations, large and small, throughout NSW to engage and educate the community about the vitality, diversity and meaning of History and its practice. The HCNSW has chosen to go with the theme ‘Hands-on History’ which was suggested by Dr Kiera Lindsey for our History Week 2022 Theme Suggestion Competition. For History Week 2022 we invite you to roll up your sleeves and get your hands dirty! History doesn’t only happen in archives, libraries and books. Very often we need to go out in the field and get hands-on to connect with different sources, stories and audiences. Hands-on History invites you to explore histories by or about people who do things with their hands, whether that is for work or play. You may also like to creatively consider how you use your hands to do history; be that digging up artefacts, uncovering archives, restoring precious and everyday objects, curating exhibitions, writing and drawing, sewing, painting, even making music or a film or podcast! We want you to re-think Hands-on History and present your ideas in History Week 2022.
: **When**: 3–-11 September 2022
: **Where**: Various events online and in person ran by NSW institutions. See links below for event calendar.

### Seminar Series and Talks
**Auckland Libraries: Heritage _Talks_ / Waha Pū-Taonga**
: **Event Description**: These talks are presented fortnightly on a Wednesday at 12 noon NZT from February to November, and topics cover a wide range of subjects relation to history. Social, local and family history, New Zealand, Australian and world history. Sometimes if something special is offered, we also schedule talks on the “off” Wednesday. Speakers are a mix of amateur and professional historians, archivists, librarians, museum specialists, authors and academics.
: Our talks are held **in-person** (subject to the COVID restrictions), and **also held live via Zoom**. We have been streaming our talks via Zoom since the first lockdown in March 2020, and they have been very successful. This means that our talks can still go-ahead even if we have a lockdown. Also we are really fortunate that this also means that our guest speakers don’t have to be in Auckland, nor even in New Zealand! Our audience is also much more geographically diverse.
: **CFP**: Heritage _Talks_ is also seeking speakers for the second half of the year – June to November.
: **When**: Wednesday at 12 noon NZT from February to November.

**Explorers by the IFPH / FIHP**
: **Event Description**: Series of monthly talks and events ran by the [IFPH / FIHP](https://ifph.hypotheses.org/){:target="_blank"}. This is a space devoted to promoting research and building bridges between public historians around the world. Our goal is to encourage communication and open pathways to advance the field.

**The Wilson History Oration**
: **Event Description**: Associate Professor Tanya Evans will present the inaugural Wilson History Oration for Professional Historians Australia. The Oration is an annual online lecture for an eminent speaker to reflect and share experiences on history research, writing and audience engagement. Tanya’s presentation will take a deep dive into a multi-faceted approach to public history. The oration will be centred on one of Tanya’s current projects – an historic site in the Blue Mountains in NSW – and she will discuss her collaboration with local and family historians, environmental specialists, heritage practitioners and archaeologists.
: The Oration has been established in memory of Dr Bill Wilson OAM (1942-2021). Bill Wilson’s support for the field of public history and the work of professional historians in Australia was inspiring. Throughout his career in history Bill was a diplomatic and personable leader and an innovative administrator.

### Call For Papers
**The New Historians Conference 2022**
: **Event Description**: In the context of the pandemic and the immediate period that follows, there is a requirement to take a pause and understand the change, recalibrate, and prepare for what comes next. At the same time there are some things that remain constant, continuities that run strong through the before and after. The New Historians Conference 2022 is focused on the idea of change and continuity. We encourage contributions that concern any region of the world and speak to the conference theme from interdisciplinary perspectives. The invitation extends to researchers grounded in a variety of fields – history, anthropology, geography, international relations, linguistics, literature, philosophy, political science, sociology, Māori studies, and other social sciences. We are interested in papers that address: 1. the idea of change and continuity in cultural, social, political, or linguistic systems; 2. the agents, catalysts, or barriers to change and the struggle to control the direction of change; 3. the reception and impact of change across different time periods; 4. any parts of your larger research project where questions of change and continuity are explored. Proposals that delve into conversations about the impact of COVID-19 on various aspects of
life across diverse spaces in the globe will be a valuable addition to the discussion.
