To learn about upcoming events, please see under the 'Events' category on the [Blog Topics](/categories/) page. We also send out a newsletter bi-annually through the AAPHN email list which will list upcoming events concerning public history in Australasia. If you would like to make a post about an upcoming event, or would like for it to be included in our next newsletter, contact the AAPHN team at <arts.CAH@mq.edu.au>.
