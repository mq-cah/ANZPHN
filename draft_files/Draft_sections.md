* Public History Theses
: **Description**: A working repository of public history theses from Australasia being collected by [Ewan Coopey](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8633-6418) for the [Centre for Applied History](https://www.mq.edu.au/research/research-centres-groups-and-facilities/resilient-societies/centres/centre-for-applied-history) at Macquarie University (CAH). The aims of this project are to 1) see what direction(s) the field of public history is going in in Australasia, and 2) to draw attention to the excellent research being conducted by higher degree research candidates across Australasia. This resource is, naturally, under development (and will continue to be so), and is currently primarily focused on theses produced since 2000. If you would like to have your thesis added to the list (it must be accessible online), then please contact the CAH at <arts.CAH@mq.edu.au>.
