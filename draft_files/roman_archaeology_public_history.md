# Roman Archaeology in Australia...
Roman archaeology in Australia &endash; how to apply in Aussie context? What can I do? I envision this being teased out over several posts.

I want to engage with Public and Applied histories here (and abroad)

Initially, confused, but after some musing, lots of possibilities.
Firstly, we can:
- Applied: Apply theories and findings from people of the past to engage with issues and concepts of todays - how did humans of the past address issues we face?
Secondly, we can do public access (online), so the geographical communities, and the Australia, can engage with the knowledge production and heritage (however they wish).
- Public History/consumption of history: Public Access of Data and Papers to increase public accessibility and development of public histories.
