However, the language of empowerment and openness employed by DNA ancestry-testing companies in their publicity materials masks the important commercial and private interests at stake. Drawing particularly on the experiences of Native and Indigenous American communities, this article highlights some of the contradictions and dilemmas engendered by the industry, and questions to what extent its practices can empower users without infringing upon the rights of other groups.},

  abstract = {Since the 1960s, scholars have passionately debated whether mothers from the middle ages to the nineteenth century loved their children. Yet historians have only superficially examined the emotional relationships between women and their offspring. Building on this debate, this thesis aims to contribute to our understanding of motherhood and poverty in three ways. First, it probes the complexities of poor mothers' emotional interactions with their children. Second, it examines some of the different ways that women expressed their moral and financial connections with their offspring. Finally, it brings a new lens to the study of motherhood and poverty by comparing mother-child relationships in Gloucestershire and New South Wales. Taking letters that mothers wrote to the parish in Gloucestershire, and petitions to admit children to, and withdraw children from, the Sydney Orphan Schools, this thesis compares how women's relationships with their children are revealed in these different contexts between 1820 and 1834. It argues that poor mothers expressed or described instances of care for children in order to claim authority over them. In doing so, this research advances the work of historians who have revealed the agency of the poor, by suggesting that in this process, poor mothers also claimed authority.},

The motivations for this rejection were the artist's strong belief in the Christian God as creator and his reaction against New Age representations of Aboriginality in which the rainbow serpent signifies Aboriginal spirituality and is posited as the single creator for all of Aboriginal Australia. A conflict arose at the artist's gallery when he refused to exhibit a rainbow serpent painting by another Aboriginal artist. Publicised in the local newspaper, the rejection of these artworks started a brief public debate about the role of Christianity in Aboriginal culture. The various positions adopted by the Aboriginal protagonists highlight the complex processes of negotiation, dialogue and debate surrounding diverse constructions of identity.},

  address = {{Canberra}},
  doi = {10.25911/2E8J-H592},
  abstract = {In the one hundred years since the Great War, Australia's war memorial landscape has been dominated by a single narrative: the Anzac myth. Anzac, named for the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps, has taken on meaning outside of this acronym, to encompass the whole masculine culture of war memory in Australia. This narrative has largely excluded the experiences of everyone who is not a white man of British descent. This domination has extended to the designing and making of the war memorials that crowd the Australian landscape. But women have been memorialised, and war memorials designed by women do exist, although they have been eclipsed by the masculine nature of Anzac. Drawing on research gathered through the methods of archival research and document analysis, site visits and observation, and in-depth, semi-structured interviews, this thesis uncovers memorials designed by women and assesses the ways in which their makers have engaged with the Anzac myth, in creating memorials that are to men and to women. The focus is on Australian women, but comparisons are provided with New Zealand and Canada, and with some male memorial makers. I argue that women working in this space have both reinforced the stereotypes of heroic, matey men and grief-stricken, emotional women and pushed the boundaries of these stereotypes associated with the narrative templates that frame it. This pushing of boundaries is most readily seen in Margaret Baskerville's Edith Cavell Memorial, one of the few public sculptures in the Australian landscape that celebrates the achievements of individual women. Furthermore, this thesis argues that only in singling out these women and their work is it possible to give them the examination and recognition required to form a more inclusive and critical interpretation of war experience and its related culture in Australia.},

The experience of working on Rewind was an extraordinary one \textendash{} both exhilarating and frustrating. In this article, I draw on this experience to explore some of the issues that one faces as a `television historian'. How much control were we able to exert over our role and presence in the storytelling process? How were we used in the program and marketed in its publicity? The article also explore the qualities of television history itself: what are its flaws and virtues? How is it different from written history? It examines recent history on television to consider the media context in which Rewind was made and received. Finally, the article considers the role of historians in the making of Rewind and examines audience perceptions and responses to the program.},

Like the British genealogical quest program Who Do You Think You Are? In Their Footsteps was premised on the idea that we can understand the past in experiential and emotional terms. It stressed the connections between present-day individuals and a larger national history through their ancestor's participation in Australian military engagements. Australia's interpretation of its national past has recently been the subject of heated, politicized debate, and this program appeared at a time when Australian historians were expressing concern at a resurgence in nationalist military commemoration. Some historians regarded this affective attachment to Australia's military past with suspicion, arguing that these attachments were produced by a jingoistic political culture. Television histories, which operate in an affective register, are usually neglected in these debates. This article argues that understanding television history is essential to grasping what military history means to contemporary Australians. A close analysis of In Their Footsteps demonstrates the ways that the deeply affective mode of television history offers a complex and nuanced form of historical understanding. Such analysis can help us better understand the contemporary appeal of military history.},

  abstract = {In the late 1920s, the multinational petroleum company Shell began sponsoring filmmaking in Australia. This was the first attempt by a local industry to systematically engage the moving image in its corporate practice. The company instituted a national exhibition network which used mobile screening vans to canvas the far-reaches of rural Australia and screened films back to the Indigenous communities they depicted. From filming the desert landscape, to mapping its mileage and turning outback petrol station driveways into impromptu drive-ins; Shell's film operations represented space, sought opportunities to make it productive and fostered social spaces pitched to align the company's interests with those of the state. This thesis interrogates how Shell's ethnographic travelogues produced settler colonial space in mid-century Australia. The spatial regimes of settler colonialism are created through processes of (symbolic, practical and contested) dispossession. Structuring logics of erasure must be traced as contingent historical phenomena so as to eschew naturalizing and confirming them. The vertical integration of Shell's film practice - encompassing production,distribution and exhibition - bears witness to governing spatial ideas and practices as well as never entirely settled sites of local reception. By studying Shell's ethnographic travelogues across these three modes we glimpse how settler colonial space coheres and strains against its own productions.},

  abstract = {Across the globe, history has gone public. With the rise of the internet, family historians are now delving into archives continents apart. Activists look into and recreate the past to promote social justice or environmental causes. Dark and difficult pasts are confronted at sites of commemoration. Artists draw on memory and the past to study the human condition and make meaning in the present. As a result of this democratisation of history, public history movements have now risen to prominence. This groundbreaking edited collection takes a comprehensive look at public history throughout the world. Divided into three sections - Background, Definitions and Issues; Approaches and Methods; and Sites of Public History - it contextualises public history in eleven different countries, explores the main research skills and methods of the discipline and illustrates public history research with a variety of global case studies. What is Public History Globally? provides an in-depth examination of the ways in which ordinary people become active participants in historical processes and it will be an invaluable resource for advance undergraduates and postgraduates studying public history, museology and heritage studies},

  author = {Bailey, Matthew},
  year = {2011},
  address = {{Sydney, Australia}},
  abstract = {This thesis traces the history of large pre-planned shopping centre development in Sydney, Australia. It begins with the pre-history of international and Australian retailing and the establishment of shopping malls in America that were built to accommodate the needs and desires of an affluent, car-driving population. It charts the establishment of the early shopping centres in Sydney, beginning with Top Ryde, which opened in 1957. Local histories of a number of centres demonstrate the westward spread of retailing in the 1970s, which accompanied the emergence of discount department stores in Australia. With the city largely staked out by the 1980s, the industry turned to expansions and refurbishments to consolidate existing developments. By the end of the decade, such expansions included multiplex cinemas and food courts, confirming the shopping centre as a site of leisure and entertainment. -- Shopping centres have always been social destinations. From the 1960s to the present day, young people in particular have flocked to them as places to meet with friends and sample the latest goods on offer. Shopping centres have also been important social sites for women - the early centres were marketed almost exclusively to the housewife. As convenient, clean and safe environments that might also offer childcare facilities, they received a largely positive reception. This thesis uses oral histories, amongst other sources, to explore the social world of the shopping centre. -- With success and expansion, came calls of retail saturation and abuses of market power. In the 1980s, pedestrianisation schemes were introduced to a number of Sydney suburbs in attempts to revive local retail. Meanwhile retailing associations pursued legislation aimed at curbing the power of the largest landlords. Both had mixed success, and neither halted the growth nor success of the industry. -- Shopping centres form an important, as yet untold, component of Australia's social, economic and cultural history. This thesis explores their development, reception and impact in Sydney from the opening of Top Ryde in 1957 to the introduction of the NSW Retail Leases Act in 1994.},

  title = {Masculinity in {{Australian}} Film, 1949-1962},
  author = {Barnett, Chelsea Meredith},
  year = {2015},
  address = {{Sydney, Australia}},
  abstract = {This thesis examines the representation of masculinity in Australian films released between 1949 and 1962. Rather than one distinct and fixed model of masculinity, this thesis argues that these Australian films from the fifties represented and negotiated predominantly \textendash{} although not exclusively \textendash{} between two competing understandings of masculinity. The first was a model best represented and advocated by Prime Minister Robert Menzies, whose explicit legitimation of middle-class masculinity marked an intervention into a longer national celebration of working-class values. The second, which itself represented a challenge to this middle-class intervention, was a distinct masculinity produced through the lens of radical nationalism. Connected to the working class, radical nationalism was a contemporary leftist intellectual movement that advocated a model of masculinity inspired by the Australian nineteenth century and challenged the ostensible synonymy of Menzies and the fifties. It is the longevity of Menzies' prime ministerial reign that burdens popular images of the Australian postwar era. In both political discourse and popular culture, the fifties continue to function as a period of either stability and prosperity, or monotony and conformity. Existing historical literature has worked to dismantle this dichotomy, instead uncovering and drawing attention to the changes and transformations within both the social and political domains. Set against this backdrop of upheaval, compounded by the uncertainty of the Cold War, this thesis explores the transformations taking place in the cultural sphere of the postwar era. Rather than a passive reflection of social change, this thesis argues that the Australian cultural landscape, of which film was an important constituent, actively questioned and negotiated the competing and often contradictory meanings of masculinity that were in circulation in the fifties. Prioritising not the importance of a film's author, but rather its meaning in a specific historical moment, this thesis' exploration of fourteen Australian films through a variety of thematic analytical lenses demonstrates not only the multiple meanings of masculinity in circulation in this moment, but also film's role in constituting these meanings. Indeed, that the tension between competing masculinities was unresolved not only across the fourteen films, but within certain films also, reveals the multiple understandings of culturally legitimate masculinity in the fifties while demonstrating film as both constituted by and constitutive of historically specific gendered meanings.},

  abstract = {This thesis uncovers a hitherto unacknowledged group of female entrepreneurs in Sydney in New South Wales and in Wellington in New Zealand between 1830 and 1870. It investigates the historiographical and popular invisibility of these women in contrast to their contemporary visibility in the streets of colonial cities. Making full use of the newly available resources of the digital revolution, along with finding new uses for a range of more traditional sources, this study refutes the contentions that women retreated into domesticity after 1830 in Sydney and were contented to be mere 'colonial helpmeets' in Wellington. My research supplements recent international scholarship which argues for significant levels of female involvement in business in the wider colonial world and draws attention to the importance of pre-industrial, commercial colonial towns and cities as locations for this phenomenon. I argue that women's businesses tended to be small-scale and concentrated in particular areas but were as long-lived as male enterprises of similar size and made a significant contribution to the colonial urban economy. I consider the relevance of middle-class ideals of female domesticity for colonial women who came from further down the social scale. I look at the ways married women negotiated the inconvenience of coverture laws, which restricted their ability to act independently as well as the response of colonial legislators to the problems faced by deserted wives trying to run businesses. This study argues that widows often used small business as a strategy of survival instead of remarriage, while there were also some life-long spinsters who made a similar choice. The transnational focus of this thesis has highlighted the mobility of colonial women, many of whom used business to facilitate their mobility, while for others, their mobility was a core part of their business strategy. The recovering of these businesswomen in plain view in colonial streets challenges our view of nineteenth century women as adjuncts to male enterprise. It highlights continuities rather than disjuncture in Sydney from the early colonial period, when opportunities for female entrepreneurs have been acknowledged. Situating this study within a transnational framework shows that businesswomen were present in and connected with other colonial and English towns and cities, emphasising the global networks of empire. It complicates our perceptions of nineteenth century women as disengaged from public life. This thesis also has broader implications for the study of history in the digital age, with its plethora of searchable sources revealing previously inaccessible details about ordinary lives. My study demonstrates the importance of returning to the archive to unpick the rhetoric of the dominant voices to highlight the experiences of a more historically silent but contemporarily visible and important group of people. -- provided by Candidate.},

  abstract = {This thesis examines the historical development of anti-discrimination policy in four jurisdictions, with an emphasis on persons with disabilities. It details the development of disability discrimination legislation in the US and Australia, and of equality legislation in the UK and Canada. It is argued that more equitable policies have co-evolved with historical changes in the social construction of marginalised individuals. More specifically, the study employs an historical institutionalist framework to investigate the array of factors driving the evolution of the human rights institutions in each country. The case studies throw up a wealth of factors, but two major factors stand out, one structural, the other agential. The major structural factor is federalism. In the three federal nation-states the national jurisdiction shares power and competencies with subnational jurisdictions, with implications for human rights legislation at the federal level. This contrasts with the UK, a unitary state, but with its sovereignty now constrained by the European Union. The thesis concludes by indicating that a fertile area of future research lies in the exploration of the lineage, transmission and development of the ideas centred on human rights and justice argued by such entrepreneurs.},

  abstract = {I am an Aboriginal historian, and this thesis is a narrative of my personal research journey. Figuratively speaking, I travelled into the past as a genealogist and traced my four Aboriginal grandparents' family lines to as far back as I could go in the written historic record, which was just after the settlement of northern New South Wales. But it was the historian who slowly returned from the past to the present, unearthing interesting, turbulent and surprising histories to be placed within the context of Australian and Aboriginal history. The scope of this thesis spans five generations and examines my ancestors' lived experience, from witnessing the continuing encroachment of white settlement, to segregation on Australian Government Aborigines reserves, to the control of the Aborigines Protection Board, to the eventual exodus to the city, to radicalisation and the fight for land rights, to Aboriginal advancement and creative expression, and onwards. The connection of this past chronology to present times culminates with my own historian's ego-histoire, thus creating an unbroken umbilical and historical connection to time immemorial. The key contribution of this thesis is the disclosure of copious amounts of (previously unaccessed) archives. These Aborigines Protection Board (later the Aborigines Welfare Board) archives detail the reprehensible maltreatment of Aboriginal people and the astounding incompetence of these Australian Government bodies in their destructive determination to control Aboriginal lives. Australian Security and Intelligence Organisation files reveal that government surveillance of my family members did not end after the Aborigines Welfare Board was abolished in 1969. The primary achievement of this thesis is the illumination of the long-term struggle of Aboriginal people to wrest a living free from Australian Government control and surveillance. To finally live in this country on equal footing, with the same rights and conditions as non-Indigenous Australians. Scholarly, multi-generational Aboriginal family history research, with intense archival research on Aboriginal individuals and their entire experience through time, illuminates much more than what we already know about Aboriginal history. Additionally, it is only when this kind of historical research is placed into the cosmic, big-history context that we fully understand both the cataclysmic effect of colonisation on Indigenous Australians and their tremendous survival efforts, struggle and continuing recovery.},

She had hoped that her sons would inherit the sheep station they owned in the Wimmera in Victoria. But she had no right to it herself. Her husband's will offered a reasonable annuity to support her and the children. But, it had a catch: for that support to be paid, she had to move to Ireland with her children and live in a house her brothers-in-law would choose. English-born, she had migrated to Australia with her family when she was sixteen. She had never been to Ireland. This extraordinary story reveals much about family, women's rights, property, and the law in the British Empire of the nineteenth century.

  author = {Burkett, Melanie},
  year = {2019},
  address = {{Sydney, Australia}},
  abstract = {In the 1830s, the British government began a grand experiment in so-called 'assisted emigration'. In order to relieve pressure on an overstocked labour market at home, it offered free passages to working-class people interested in emigrating to the Australian colony of New South Wales who lacked the financial means to make the journey. Despite the pressing need for labour in the colony, the over fifty thousand workers from the British Isles who arrived in the first decade of the scheme (1832-42) were vociferously criticised in the colonial public sphere, most often on the dimensions of morality and usefulness as labourers. Early Australian migration historiography long parroted these condemnations. The picture of the assisted immigrants changed significantly in the 1990s, however, as new research deemed the criticism of the immigrants to be, on the whole, unfair. Yet, this revisionist work left an important question unanswered: if this negative reputation was largely undeserved, why did it arise in the first place? In order to answer that question, this thesis critically re-examines contemporary rhetoric surrounding immigration in the colonial public sphere and argues that colonial judgments of the arriving immigrants expressed a host of tensions surrounding self-government, the economic development of the colony, cultural constructions of class and gender, and selective dissemination of compassion. The answer to why the assisted immigrants were so maligned lies in this tangle of political, economic, and cultural factors. Political and economic tensions were shaped by cultural constructions designed to protect the elevated status of the colonial elite. Those cultural constructions influenced political manoeuvrings and were, in turn, legitimised by political rhetoric. The political, economic, and cultural overlapped, intertwined, and dialogued with each other. Thus, a comprehensive understanding of the deep resistance to Australia's earliest, (unforced) working-class immigrants - resistance that has shaped the long history of Australian immigration - requires multiple analytical perspectives.},

Online exposure is developing at an unquantifiable rate, with the Internet being the ubiquitous force that drives our everyday existence. Yet, so much of what may already exist digitally and be of interest to the architectural tourist, and others, often remains obscured or lost. There is a real need for archival retention of data as much as much as the buildings themselves, if we are to have balanced, publically accessible resources and comprehensive narratives about our built heritage.},

Through detailed research, we follow Sary from slum to tenement and from pregnancy to pregnancy. We also meet George Conquest, a canal worker and the father of one of Sary's children. George was sentenced - for stealing a piece of hemp - to seven years' transportation to Australia, where he faced the extraordinary brutality of convict life. Meanwhile, Mary Ann Brooks and her father John, a silversmith, travel across the seas from Lincolnshire to escape the Workhouse and life as a skivvy. But for George, as for so many destitute and disenfranchised British people like him, Australia turned out to be his Happy Day. He survived, prospered and eventually returned to England, where he met Sary again, after nearly thirty years. He brought her out to Australia, and they were never parted again. Carmen Callil not only reclaims from obscurity the lives of these ordinary men and women who were sent to Australia as convicts or domestic servants, but also draws telling parallels for our own times. Oh Happy Day is a moving story of poverty, social injustice, Empire and migration."--Amazon.ca},

Pervasive in every aspect of Indigenous life is a traditional spirituality, "the Dreaming", that is also essentially tied to the Land. While Indigenous culture and the Christianity brought by missionaries in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries can co-exist, contemporary Indigenous wellbeing is inseparable from spiritual wellbeing and in particular secure ownership of the land. Indigenous peoples of the world have a particular collective value as holders of a living heritage about the meaning of what it really is to be a human in relation to the natural world. The second half of the paper clarifies and reflects upon the reaction to research conducted by the author when Race Discrimination Commissioner and certain preliminary findings of that research. In the face of negative reaction in some quarters it is argued that people of faith should have nothing to fear about proposals to enshrine freedom of religion and belief in law.},

  author = {{Cameron Bruce Nunn}},

  address = {{Sydney, Australia}},
  abstract = {During the transportation period, Britain sent twenty-five thousand convict boys who were seventeen years or under to the Australian colonies. Three thousand five hundred of those boys were sent to Carters' Barracks (1820-1834), in Sydney or Point Puer (1834-1849), adjacent to Port Arthur in Tasmania. This was a bold new 'experiment' in reforming young criminals into productive members of society. What is particularly interesting is that this ideological 'experiment' was the first of its kind, anywhere in the world. This thesis is concerned with the complex ways that the juvenile convict was imagined by law-makers, reformers, penal authorities and especially the boys themselves. It argues that the ideology that surrounded juvenile transportation from the 1820s finds unique expression in the institutions of Carters' Barracks and Point Puer. It is also interested in the relationship between the boys and the various figures of penal authority, arguing that these relationships created a dynamic discursive and political space, characterised by power, resistance, compliance and subversion. It considers how often juxtaposing ideas of what it meant to be male, reformed and a useful colonial worker were played out through the myriad daily transactions at Carters' Barracks and Point Puer. It is in this relational and physical crucible, that juvenile male convict subjectivity was manifested. By focussing therefore on subjectivity, this thesis goes beyond the traditional approach of describing juvenile penal practice, exploring a wide range of primary source documents that have often been neglected by historians and offering new perspectives on juvenile convictism.},

The second half of the paper discusses Aboriginal scientific principles which actually celebrate the social negotiation of knowledge, and the use of metaphor for building and recording knowledge. The paper discusses how these principles have been introduced into our school curriculum by tribal community elders, and how they influence knowledge production in the classroom.},

  author = {Claringbold, Erin},

  address = {{Sydney, Australia}},
  abstract = {This thesis examines the representation (and self-representation) of Arabs and Muslims in the outback in Australian literature and film in the period beginning in 1890 and ending in 2011. Much of this analysis focuses upon portrayals of the 'Afghan' cameleers, as the first Muslim and Arab community that emigrated to and settled in White Australia, and whose presence in Australia garnered significant public attention. While recent focus has been given to a recovery of the cameleer history, this thesis seeks to address the dearth of attention paid to how this history became translated into fictional portrayals. -- The thesis argues that the representation of the Afghan cameleers, while drawing upon Orientalist and colonialist ideologies and bodies of knowledge, helped to establish a tradition of Arab and Muslim representation that is specific to Australia. This tradition of representation is framed by two major practices of 'deviance and absence', wherein Muslims and Arabs are simultaneously demonized and imagined as external to Australia. Despite historical shifts in attitudes, these practices have carried through to current imaginings of Arabs and Muslims in Australia and are most evident in post 9/11 Islamophobic discourse. -- The focus upon representations of Arabs and Muslims in the outback is premised upon the significance of this landscape as a space of inherent political and national significance within the Australian imaginary. How Australia has imagined itself with relation to Arabs and Muslims is effectively allegorised in their fictional portrayal within this landscape, where they are often portrayed as those who encroach, invade, corrupt and devalue the outback, and by extension the nation. Alternatively, they are absented from the landscape altogether, their history co-opted either by white men or by the camel, which metonymically displaces them. -- In relation to these representations, the thesis also examines evidence of a tradition of counter-discourse, extending from 1890-2011, which has sought to fight against these absenting or demonizing practices and to emplace the cameleers within Australia's historical narrative. As part of this counter-discourse, attention is also paid to Muslim-Australian self-representations in the outback (unconnected to the Afghan cameleer history) and the most recent evolution of this tradition in refugee literature set in the outback, either inside or outside of detention centres.},

Developing this method of philosophy requires a novel account of knowers, knowledge and reality which can tell a story of difference that goes further than one of `social' positionings, and that credits the potential of the research practice itself to generate novel ways of working within and across boundaries. This account has philosophy proceeding through three moves: locating the researcher in the embodied collective situation of the investigation; crediting multiple knowledges through adopting the figure of an outsider; and valuing the vagueness and multiplicity that characterize boundaries through understanding reality as emergent. It is argued that this account does not supersede others, but rather adds to them within a logic of transdisciplinarity.},

For example, what does historical inheritance look like? How does it influence our individual and collective historical consciousnesses? And, just as critically, what happens to historical consciousness when history is deliberately withheld, when that inheritance is suspended or severed? As a way into some of these questions about passing on the past, this paper draws on a qualitative research project into historical consciousness in Australia to explore how so-called 'ordinary people' see themselves as part of a historical narrative. It reveals that historical inheritance is critical to our historical consciousness, and it notes the profound impact of forgetting on participants, raising important questions about the role of 'silence' and 'absence' in the formation of historical consciousness.}

Separated by two hundred years and 17,000 kilometers, they nonetheless followed remarkably similar trajectories; relative peace followed by aggressive settler expansion, the clash of two radically different military cultures, and the physical removal of the remaining indigenous survivors. Using the innovative field of settler colonial studies, this thesis will comparatively examine settler colonial violence in Connecticut and Tasmania. As a burgeoning number of works in the field have shown, settler colonial studies lends itself well to global and comparative approaches, as well as trans temporal ones. However, to date, there have been very few studies of the latter. This project will analyse the structural attributes of settler colonial violence comparatively and trans temporally to identify the ways in which they manifest in different cultural contexts and temporal frameworks. More broadly, it will seek to provide a detailed analysis of how the operative logic of settler colonialism can inform and shape seemingly unrelated events, and further the understanding of this distinctive and pervasive process.},

This article examines the value of digital storytelling to history teaching and learning in the tertiary history environment. We show that tertiary history students might find new modes of conducting and presenting historical knowledge by using new technologies, as well as adapting `traditional' modes of historical research and writing for the new format. In particular, we evaluate the potential of digital storytelling in the classroom from three angles: first, as a way of building group rapport through emotional exchange and sharing ideas; second, as a way of learning a new digital tool for classroom learning; and third, as a site for making public histories. This process and our research suggests new ways of `doing history' to other academics teaching history in order to enrich and encourage the discipline among an increasingly changing student cohort and in an interdisciplinary context.},

  address = {{Sydney}},
  abstract = {What happens when a monumental object is physically destroyed? Is its ``life" as a socially significant, presencing object at an end? Or might the process of destruction paradoxically work to enhance its symbolic force and power? This thesis examines the ``afterlife" of two monumental social objects, physically transformed through acts of cultural destruction, and their contested reconfiguration in new, highly political contexts. In 1993, the Mostar Bridge, in the small city of Mostar, in Bosnia Herzegovina, was completely destroyed, during a vicious war that killed thousands and was marked by widespread destruction of cultural heritage. Reconstructed in 2004, as an exact copy of the original, this ``new Old Bridge" has assumed an afterlife as an intentional monument to reconciliation. The World Trade Centre, in New York, has also been reconfigured since its destruction in 2001, as a place of national mourning and memory, in relation to a singular act of terrorism. Both sites negotiate the difficult memory work associated with traumatic events, and represent very different examples of monumental transformation in this context. Whilst much work on the monumental place has considered its social life as a mnemonic technology, and its role in the spatialization of national memory, there has been less consideration of the ``afterlife" of the monumental place marked by traumatic destruction. Embodying not only the residue of past lives, but also the imprint of historical rupture, the liminal status of the place of monumental destruction, raises questions about the processes through which meaning and affect are destroyed and produced, and memories erased and inscribed. This thesis analyses the contested reconfiguration of both places, as sites of collective remembering and forgetting, and their re-investment with cultural value and symbolic significance. The cultural materiality and material culture associated with both ``things" have been central to this process, mobilized as strategic resources with which to shape and redirect public memory in relation to the recent traumatic past. Far from being forgotten or erased, through acts of cultural destruction, I thus consider the ways in which both ``things''' have continued to be imbued with meaning, memory and a form of mediating agency, that is affective as much as conceptual, assuming a potent ``afterlife" in the present.},

The primary theoretical aim of this detailed case study is to interrogate the means by which the State (represented by the Parliament and the state and federal bureaucracies, with the cooperation of the media) was able to secure the willing participation of an overwhelming majority of the population. The elements of this study are drawn principally from government archives, the vast media coverage of the day, extensive oral history interviews with participants, and academic literature in the areas of Australian history (with particular reference to the nineteen-fifties), popular royalism, popular culture, public memory, civic ritual and spectacle. It was my final objective that these elements and aims might be synthesised into an enjoyable, 'popular' account of this chaotic, surprising and memorable event.},

  author = {Dawson, Barbara},
  year = {2007},
  address = {{Canberra}},
  abstract = {This thesis explores aspects of identity, gender and race in the narratives of six white women who wrote about their experiences with Australian Aborigines. Five of the works relate to nineteenth-century frontier encounters, described by middle-class, genteel women who had travelled to distant locations. The sixth (colonial-born) woman wrote about life in outback Queensland in both the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century. Her perceptions and opinions act as a foil to the five other texts, written by British-born authors. My analysis of these works takes into account current colonial racial attitudes and the nineteenth-century utilitarian urge to "educate". It involves discussion of the influences during the nineteenth century of the Enlightenment idea of "man's place in nature", of evangelical Christianity and the role of underlying notions of race based on scientific theories. All these aspects inform the women's works, directly or indirectly. While reflecting ideas about Aborigines expressed in male colonial narratives, these female writers deal with their relationship with Aborigines from a woman's perspective. I have researched the women's social and economic backgrounds in order to investigate biographical factors which lay behind their racial views and perceptions. The thesis explores the influences of publishers requirements and reader expectations on the way Aborigines were represented in published works. The writer\^a\texteuro\texttrademark s need to entertain her audience, as well as to "educate" them, often led her to incorporate the traits and language of popular literary trends. Two of these were English Victorian romantic fiction, and the "ripping yarn" adventure narrative, popular from the late nineteenth century. The incorporation of these literary genres often resulted in conflicting messages, and a confused and ambivalent rendition of Aborigines. Within the dynamics of the male power structure at the frontier, these selected female narratives offer another perspective on interracial relations. The six texts refer to the fractious climate of colonisation. They are told by women mostly constrained within the expectations of ladylike decorum and often strongly influenced by the abiding literary contexts of the nineteenth century. What the writings show is that as women grew to know Indigenous people as individuals, representations of Indigenous humanity, agency and authority replace racial cliches and stereotypes, and literary imperatives.},

  abstract = {While the cultural history and practices of press photography in Australia have gained scholarly attention in recent years, the contribution of other forms of photography published in magazines\textemdash including editorial, advertising and readers' photographs\textemdash to burgeoning concepts of nationhood has been largely overlooked. This thesis examines the role of photography in visualising a post-war `imagined community' in a study of The Australian Women's Weekly magazine, the highest-circulating weekly publication in the country, between the end of the Second World War in 1945 and the introduction of television in 1956. In its examination of these photographs, the thesis asks: What narratives of national identity were evident in the photographs? What subject matter and framing techniques were frequently employed to construct a national photographic language? And what does this reveal about the values the Weekly's publisher and editors attached to being Australian? I argue that the Weekly was not passively depicting or reflecting a national community and its `Way of Life', but that it actively constructed an Australian identity through the thousands of photographs it published, while simultaneously instructing its readers what good citizenship looked like\textemdash and how to perform their belonging to the nation. Visual analysis of over 200 photographs highlights the predominant narratives during the period, including an emphasis on the practice of family photography to reinforce ideals of urban, family life as centred within the modern home. Representations of immigration and Aboriginal Australians, the repetition of photographs of families participating in community events, and a valorisation of the rural worker's relationship with the land were intertwined with the concepts of ordinariness and of the `Australian Way of Life'. These core ideals were deployed to enable multiple and potentially oppositional narratives to coexist on the pages of the magazine. Analysis of a series of readers' colour travel photographs published in the later years of the study foregrounds the Weekly's encouragement of its readers as collaborators by providing them with an opportunity to demonstrate their performance of national identity. The magazine thus became a platform through which readers contributed to the visual narrative of Australianness, via the medium of photography as a form of participatory citizenship. The thesis foregrounds the implementation of a high-speed printing press in 1950 as a turning point at which readers saw a significant increase in the publication of colour photographs of native flora and fauna, and specifically photographs of ordinary Australians within the landscape. I argue that Alice Jackson and Esme Fenston, the Weekly's editors during the period of study, positioned it as the mediator of knowledge about Australia, and constructed a relationship with readers based on notions of intimacy and authority. Situated within the multidisciplinary field of visual culture, and drawing from photography studies, visual anthropology, cultural history and media studies, the thesis highlights the cultural work of photography in the process of imaging, and imagining, post-war Australia.},

  year = {2012},
  address = {{Sydney, Australia}},
  abstract = {The media, particularly film, plays a powerful role in the making and unmaking of national identity and identities. In the so-called British settler societies it has often been the first and most significant source of exposure to Indigenous peoples for non-Indigenous audiences. This is particularly so in Australia where the Indigenous population, if not `out of sight, out of mind', has always been on the peripheries except, notably, in film and literature, where Indigenous representations have helped forge particular versions of Australianess. From the first such filmic depiction in 1907 to the most recent in 2009 there has been a continuous re/working of Indigenous character types. Focusing primarily on the silent era of Australian filmmaking (c.1906-1928) this thesis analyses the ways in which Indigenous Australian cinematic characters have been invented and re-invented. But, instead of using Charles Chauvel's iconic film Jedda (1955) as a starting point for discussion of Indigenous Australian characterisations, as so many film histories in Australia do, I use it as a reference point. Rather than moving forward from Jedda, I go back, exploring the significant history that culminated in Chauvel's Indigenous characterisations. In doing so I contribute to the scholarship in three ways. The first is by addressing a gap that exists in the literature regarding Indigenous characterisations in the silent era. The second contribution stems from my challenge to the accepted wisdom that typically links Indigenous Australian characterisations with Hollywood's depiction of Native Americans. I argue that although some of these comparisons are appropriate, blanket comparisons of this kind over-simplify the reality and neglect the ii important contrasts and comparisons to be made between Indigenous Australian and African American characterisations in silent films. Thirdly, I use Jedda as the basis of my typology of Indigenous Australian characters that allows me to investigate the preferred Indigenous Australian cast of characters. That preferred cast includes the Indigenous Australian `tracker' character, the `wild' or `tribal black' and the `comic black'. I also add to the scholarship by interrogating why, despite the acknowledged influence of Hollywood, three popular Native American and African American characters \textendash{} the individualised warrior chieftain, the sexually predatory `black buck' and the romantic heroine \textendash{} were omitted from the silent Indigenous Australian cast.},

  abstract = {Bonegilla was Australia's first, largest and longest-lived post World War Two migrant reception and training centre, chosen because of its remote rural location. Bonegilla was designed to delimit interactions between Non-English speaking immigrants and the Australian population. The Bonegilla camp's purpose was to provide a tractable, mobile labour force, and to assimilate a large population of immigrant aliens and naturalise them, to use the vernacular of the post-war period. English was asserted as a lingua franca. Central to Australian concepts of assimilation are isolation, segregation and containment. This thesis researches Bonegilla using the methodology of site-specific reading, to engage with the tropes and narratives emergent at the heritsge listed site. Two canonical texts whose authors have a direct relationship to Bonegilla are examined. Close readings of Les Murray's poem 'Immigrant Voyage' and Christos Tsiolkas's short story 'Saturn Return' are undertaken. The scenes of reading implicit in each text and how each text is in dialogue with texts from Bonegilla specific to immigrant and Anglo-Saxon relations, are examined. This thesis proposes that contemporary transnational literary studies neglect the assimilation era, which remains a marginalised discourse, over-written by tropes of celebratory multiculturalism. This thesis demonstrates that assimilation policies created a lacuna evident within the texts examined, and in the contested discourses present at the Bonegilla site.},

I suggest herein lies an opportunity to recover and engage through the prism of ethnography the heritage of modern philosophies of mind and nature. Taking tentative steps in that direction I venture to discern epistemic alignments between the self-world relationship as envisaged by the Anangu living at Pukatja in the eastern part of Australia's Western Desert, Friedrich Schelling's idea of a first nature, and Sigmund Freud's notion of the life and death instincts. My discussion, focused on the emergent Anangu perspectives on nature, explores an ontological monism facing uncertainty. I approach its vicissitudes by examining the metaphoricity in the Indigenous figuring of the link between spirit and being, including inflections through Christianity that the Anangu are juxtaposing with the reality of Dreamings.},

This paper examines the interrelations of memory, history and belonging among former coal miners in the north Nottinghamshire coalfield surrounding Mansfield, UK, an area of complex and contested memories and histories. Couched in the approaches of emotional geographies and the `turn to affect', the paper investigates the emotional and affective dimensions of remembering histories of the coal industry under nationalisation between 1947 and 1994 including job security, the 1984\textendash 1985 miners' strike and colliery closures, as well as the industrial ruination which these closures caused. To fully apprehend and empathise with the emotional processes of memory, the paper contends that memories must always be situated within a reading of the wider historical geographies and politics upon which they are constituted. Drawing on archival research and psychosocial life history interviews, the paper broadly argues that historicising memories as well as examining their affective dimensions advances understanding into what has been lost and disrupted through localised processes of deindustrialisation and postindustrialism. In the case of north Nottinghamshire the contested solidarities of the miners' strike and subsequent colliery closures have endured in affective memories which, in turn, have problematised the production of individual and collective belonging.},

What is the place of "family"\textendash and of family memories\textendash in this burgeoning field? And how can the concept of memory be used as a tool in comparative family research? This article presents, first, the main notions of Maurice Halbwachs's theory of m\'emoire collective and asks how the sociologist places family within collective memory. Second, it discusses how the "new memory studies" of the 1980s and 1990s, which clearly showed a bias towards large-scale, often national memories, can be refocused through the lens of small-scale family memories. Third, it provides an overview of current research on the dynamics of remembering within families. It discusses how new approaches, which are based mostly on qualitative interviewing, have adopted innovative transgenerational, transnational, and media culture perspectives. La critique culturelle de la m\'emoire collective demande comment on construit et reconstruit le "pass\'e" dans des contextes socioculturels.

Et comment peut-on conceptualiser la "m\'emoire" dans la recherche comparative sur la famille?

  title = {Still: A Cultural History of Press Photography in {{Australia}}},
  author = {Evans, K. L.},
  year = {2001},
  address = {{Sydney}},
  abstract = {This thesis traces a cultural history of press photography in Australia from the 1890s to the 1950s, from its inception through to its highpoint as the most influential visual form in the country, and before its eclipse by television. Photography is one of the defining visual forms of the twentieth-century, significant for its everyday interpretive role and for its wider role in defining and shaping cultural memory. Press photography was ubiquitous and popular in the period covered by this study, and with that came many presumptions about its meaning and role: a close history of this period serves to revise assumptions, and to place photography firmly in history. This thesis argues that the development of press photography, and the eventual crystallisation of its many varieties, was not inevitable or teleological. There was considerable experimentation and uncertainty in the incipient form, as photographers, journalists, reading publics, editors, proprietors and other elements of the newspaper press grappled with what photography could do. A specific history of this development allows for a better understanding of the way press photography developed as a cultural as well as a visual practice. Any deep understanding of press photography and its role in Australian culture must view the photograph as a site of cultural production, located in specific historical circumstances \textendash{} and therefore the role of the press photographer is crucial. The photograph and photographer are entwined. In order to understand this connection, this study deliberately focuses on the 'ordinary' on-staff press photographer and the regular photographs produced. This is not a history of well-known or iconic images and name photographers: the 'banal' photograph, it is argued, is as culturally significant as the recognised one, and also contributes to visual understanding. The banal photograph allows access to the complex ways in which abstractions are visualised and the ways in which Australia has been presented back to itself. By viewing such a photograph via the work practices and world view of the photographer who made it, the significance of the visual is both grounded in its history and contributes to a more complex history. This then is also a contributory history of work and of 'invisible' photographers. It allows the photographers' presence to appear both in and out of the frame. By linking these 'other' types of photography to their photographer, 'the photograph' can be understood in a different way. Production transforms the photograph, allowing the mugshot and the iconic news photo to be significant in the creation of a national visual culture.},

Using Australian history as a case study, this collection draws on leading contributions from academics and public intellectuals to explore the ways national identities still resonate in historical scholarship and reexamines key moments in Australian history, with a transnational lens, raising important questions about the unique context of Australia's national narrative. The book examines the tension between national and transnational perspectives, attempting to internationalise the often parochial nation-based narratives that characterise national history, such as the history wars or the glorification of the Anzac Legend, whilst bearing in mind the limits of transnational histories in a national setting. Moving from the local and personal to the global, encompassing comparative and international research and drawing on the experiences of researchers working across nations and communities, this collection brings together diverging national and transnational approaches and asks several critical research questions: What is transnational history? How do new transnational readings of the past challenge conventional national narratives and approaches? What are implications of transnational and international approaches on Australian history? What possibilities do they bring to the discipline? What are their limitations? And finally, how do we understand the nation in this transnational moment?},

  abstract = {Between 1965 and 1996 the population of the area now incorporated in the Bega Valley Shire more than doubled. A set of factors transformed the economic, social and demographic profile and composition of the south-eastern corner of New South Wales. The region transitioned from an economy based on dairy farming to one with an increasing presence of rural residential living, 'alternative' and post-retirement settlement, the growth of a tourism industry and the establishment of new national parks. This process has been identified by geographer John Holmes as a multifunctional rural transition. Histories of non-urban places in Australia during this period focus on declining communities west of the Great Dividing Range. As populations increased along the eastern seaboard, rural geographers and sociologists conducted broad, quantitative studies. But this history follows the call to explore local history from the 'parish pump to the cosmos' by considering the interplay of resident and local government responses to the differing aspirations and expectations of individual newcomers, layered with increasing state government regulation of the development of non-urban spaces. It explores what geographer Doreen Massey terms 'throwntogetherness'. Contests over development were central to these transitions, particularly over land use, environmental values and issues of social, economic and cultural change. This thesis tracks several of these conflicts, assessing the interests and identities engaged in them and analysing the experience of those people drawn into new forms of political action, organisation and regulation. Exploring what was learned by participants in these contests over land use brings both individual and historical perspectives to the local negotiation of pressures and opportunities shaping many aspects of Australian society and governance at that time. This thesis draws on testimony from interviews with nineteen participants who were leaders in disputes selected to illustrate these historical processes. Their experiences of, and reflections on, navigating regulatory structures and seeking satisfactory outcomes reveals how individuals came to understand the bases of conflict and the capacities required to move through and beyond them. Their testimony is placed in the context of wider debates and official responses, including the minutes of local government meetings, reports of local officials, newspaper reports and the policy and legislative frameworks in which local and state governments worked to understand the impact and progress of these debates. Studying a local area crosses subject boundaries, and this thesis draws on ideas from geography and sociology while focusing on personal stories of the struggles of people of diverse backgrounds as they attempted to fulfil their aspirations for ways of living and working in a challenged, and challenging, rural context. Legacies of these transitions have enduring consequences, many of which came into sharp focus in the conflagration that impacted villages and displaced residents and tourists in the Bega Valley between December 2019 and February 2020.},

  year = {2018},
  address = {{Sydney}},
  abstract = {Historians have considered deeply the nature of historical fiction, and the fictional nature of history, but children's historical fiction has received little of their attention to date. In approaching Australian children's historical novels and picture books as a subject for historical analysis, I interrogate the specific cultural, social, political and intellectual contexts of these texts since 1945. I explore how the texts may be considered historical, rather than literary projects, projects that can work to either contest or reaffirm contemporaneous national historical narratives. Fictional representations of the past are an identifiable sub-genre within Australian children's literature, with an estimated 160 historical novels and picture books, on Australian subjects by Australian authors, published since 2000. Building upon a foundation that emerged slowly in the decades following World War Two, contemporary Australian authors are creating fictional narratives for children that encompass an increasingly diverse range of historical subjects and that push at the boundaries of the historical fiction genre. There have also been profound changes in the presentation and marketing of historical novels and picture books, changes that offer an opportunity to understand more about uses of the past in the context of conceptions of childhood in Australian society. My thesis traces the volume and nature of historical novels and picture books published since 1945, explores representations of war, Indigenous history, and emotion through close readings of selected texts, and considers ideas of spectatorship and audience through analyzing the results of a pilot study involving interviews with fourteen children. In doing so, I contribute to conversations about uses of the past beyond the academy and methodologies for researching popular/fictional historiography. I also demonstrate that fictional representations of Australia's past created for children are worthy of historians' attention.},

In addition, although a global perspective is important given the widespread nature of the gold rushes and aspects of the experience being 'shared', framing questions in terms of local patterns and influence may render overarching global interpretations less tenable.]}

Due to the passage of time, the commemoration and collective memory of the event may change its significance and relevance due to changes in the associated social, political,  and cultural landscape. This article examines the commemorative events associated with three tragic incidents that occurred on Australian soil, namely, the 175th anniversary of the Myall Creek massacre held in 2013, the 70th anniversary of the Second World War bombing of Darwin held in 2012,  and the 10th anniversary of the Port Arthur massacre held in 2006. National identity and commemorative events are strongly connected and the article examines these particular anniversaries and commemorative events in the context of Australian national identity, collective memory, and how the  significance of these commemorations may change from generation to generation. The article finds each of the commemorative events have altered in their significance and are now remembered in a different light, with the Myall Creek massacre reflecting aspects of Aboriginal reconciliation; the  bombing of Darwin reflecting Australia's role on the world's political stage; and the Port Arthur massacre highlighting Australia's strict gun laws.},

  address = {{Sydney}},
  abstract = {The reenactment of the past itself has a history. This thesis analyses self-styled 'historical reenactors' in the West and traces the history of the broader phenomenon of historical reenactment in the Australian context from the late nineteenth century to the present. The historical section focuses on several events significant in Australian cultural memory that have been reenacted over time. Historical parades, pageants and reenactments dramatically narrate culturally specific historical sensibilities and demonstrate inter and cross cultural exchanges of historical consciousness. I contend such performances have had a significant position in the formation of popular history since the late nineteenth century and that there is a continuity of conventions in performing the past. I have addressed the position of reenactments as part of a constant interest in the status and power of history in, and for, popular culture. I have shown how a form of history that operated for the public was transformed into a form of history operated by the public in a struggle for authority over the form and content of history. Historical reenactments have been useful avenues for elites to create didactic spectacular history that have also offered the opportunity for marginalised groups to make social and political gains through their participation in the making of public history. Considering the significance of reenactments in the formation of a distinctly Australian public history, they have received little attention from historians. As ephemera, reenactments sit awkwardly in the explanatory frameworks regularly used by historians. Using methodologies from a range of academic disciplines such as performance studies, anthropology and cultural studies, this thesis documents and interrogates the specific form of historical reenactment. In the sections of this thesis that analyse contemporary historical reenactments, I use my own experience as an historical reenactor of more than ten years in an ethnographic approach that reflects on the pleasures, promises and problems 'dressing up as if from the past' offers. In this history I draw continuities between past reenactments and present practices that assist in understanding historical reenactment as a specific cultural form. This thesis contends that reenactments over time have been characterised by three main elements: a collapsing of past and present, an avenue for a 'connectedness' with the past through a sensual experience, and an essential relationship with I authenticity.'},

  year = {2013},
  abstract = {In 2007 the Sydney Opera House was inscribed onto UNESCO's World Heritage List as a masterpiece of 20th century architecture and engineering, and for its value as a `world-famous iconic-building'. The inscription serves to establish the building's international significance, yet methods to evidence and better understand its social value for global audiences remains largely unaddressed. The thesis investigates and evidences the building's social value through practices in popular culture enabled and made visible by the recent growth of online participatory media, arguing that such representations of the building and the online interactions around these are cultural practices through which people engage with the Sydney Opera House. Further, these practices are significant because they offer individuals and groups a means to negotiate their collective and individual senses of identity.  Using the concept of participatory culture the thesis explores the anecdotal attachment people have for this work of iconic architecture. Through visual analysis of a collection of online representations gathered on Pinterest.com the social value of this place is evidenced in the everyday engagements of people that are inspired by the building, such as visiting it, collecting souvenirs, posting photographs or making opera-house-shaped cakes. Closer observations of participation in photosharing groups on Flickr.com and tributes posted to the Sydney Opera House Utzon Memorial website demonstrate that such popular activities are complex social negotiations of memory and identity. The investigation concludes that social value is a cultural process; one that is co-constituted between tangible, intangible and digital forms of culture.  The thesis is located at the intersection of architecture, heritage studies and media studies. The argument builds on the scholarly contributions of Terry Smith, Leslie Sklair, Jose van Dijck and Henry Jenkins as well as the discourses on World Heritage, Intangible Heritage and Digital Heritage to demonstrate that although at present participatory culture of architecture is unable to be recognised by UNESCO's suite of heritage instruments, the everyday social engagements around the Sydney Opera House contribute to its broader cultural significance.},

  abstract = {Since the 1980s, industrialised countries have increasingly attempted to prevent the arrival to their territories of asylum seekers and refugees. Such policies have, however, generally proven ineffective and dangerous for refugees, as well as being politically highly charged. Despite the failings, popular support for less restrictive policies has not grown significantly, if at all. -- This thesis adopts a historical institutionalist research design to investigate these issues. It examines the consequences of conflicts between policy-makers, the deficiencies of enforcement mechanisms, and increasing institutional complexity for the effectiveness and legitimacy of refugee admission policies. It does so through the lens of a comparative study of refugee admission in Britain and Australia from the end of the Second World War to the end of Tony Blair's and John Howard' s Prime Ministerships in 2007. Although their immigration history is very different, Britain and Australia have, since the 2000s, developed preventive policies that have failed to achieve expected results. This has seldom been discussed, much less explained, in existing scholarship, which is why these two cases are the focus of this thesis. -- The thesis shows that Australia and Britain present similar trajectories in regards to the evolution of discrepancies between policy objectives and outcomes in refugee admission. These discrepancies dramatically expanded from the 1980s, and have become increasingly complex during the 2000s. The thesis points to a clear correlation between increasing institutional complexity and decreasing policy effectiveness and legitimacy; in contrast, the significance of conflicts between policy-makers, and of the deficiencies of enforcement mechanisms, varies over time and across cases. This finding has significant implications for the identification of institutional settings conducive to more effective, legitimate and equitable refugee policies.},

Using the interrelationship between the objects and memories which emerge from the interviews I will discuss the establishment of family and cultural traditions, why people invest objects with particular meanings, the role of gender in the keeping of objects and raise issues regarding the place of personal memory and privately held objects in public history and museology.},

Active from the 1880s to the 1910s, he had a prominent position in Victoria's medical fraternity. He is primarily remembered as an example of the persistence of contagionist-theory denialism in Australia during this period. Such characterisation grossly simplifies his nuanced views and the rationale behind them. Turner held legitimate concerns regarding the social stigma faced by sufferers of tuberculosis, and sought to promote the importance of a healthy environment and climate in preventing chest diseases. Turner's contribution to medicine should therefore be re-examined, as an example of an individual contesting the discrimination experienced by people with chronic conditions and in need of care.}

The concept of ruins as a tourist attraction in Australia has correlations with the European construct of teh Grand Tour and its modern counterpart -mass tourism. The romancing of the ruins of the old prison site began to occur very soon after bushfires swept through the settlement creating what some commentators referred to as "Australia's own Tintern Abbey".},

It is not clear how this occurs, even though the links seem substantial.Method: We explore how mental health and SEWB may be linked to attachment to country, spirituality, and engagement in music and arts by reviewing literature and presenting examples from our research with Indigenous communities. Rather than abstracting, our goal is to describe specific examples encompassing the rich contextual details needed to understand the factors contributing to mental health and SEWB.Results: While engagement in music is often seen as benefiting mental health because thoughts and feelings can be expressed in less public ways, it can also lead to employment and access to economic and social resources. Attachment to country also shows a plethora of positive outcomes which can contribute to mental health and SEWB even when not explicitly aimed at doing so, such as reducing conflictual situations.Conclusions: We conclude that more detailed, contextual research is required to fully explore the links between creative enterprises and mental health and SEWB outcomes.}

  abstract = {This thesis casts new light on the clothing culture of the first Europeans who engaged with the land now called Australia in New South Wales, at Botany Bay and the area around Sydney Cove. Many people assume that life for the `First Fleeters' must have been crude and rough, devoid of any sartorial fashion element. Yet the naval officers would have been well dressed, albeit somewhat dusty, and the First, Second and Third Fleets carried numerous people who had worked in Britain in the appearance industries.  But what of the women? A large number of the convicts transported to New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land has been convicted for felonies connected with clothing theft. Clothing including accessories such as ribbons and handkerchiefs were valuable at the time but also demotic: they were not the preserve of the middling sorts and elites.  Many of the transported convicts were women who had worked in the burgeoning fashion culture of late-eighteenth century Europe. Yet little work has been conducted on their clothing lives.  In this thesis, I speculate as to the appearance of the convict women. I do not disparage them as the discarded, unwanted and unattractive ones as some historians as well as popular images, movies and television series have done in the past. Instead I use traces \textendash{} in the written record such as diaries, transcripts and transportation lists \textendash{} mapping this information onto the history of early advertising and the press in the colony, as well as analysing the visual sources that survive from this period.  I work within the frameworks that recognise the value of material culture, object analysis and also the new fashion studies and fashion histories that demand that the poor and everyday be considered as worthy of study as the dress and habits of the elite.  I adopt at times a poetic speaking position, as most of these women were illiterate and they certainly can no longer `speak'. Yet traces of their material culture, their backgrounds and their narratives suggest that a more robust and vibrant fashion culture probably existed from the very beginning of the European settlement/invasion that most historians have credited. It is my aim that my understanding of the materiality of cloth and clothing will map onto surviving traces, gestures and hints to enable a new story to be told of the first years of western fashion in the Antipodes.},

  abstract = {The ordinary stories of ordinary Aboriginal people are a necessary part of Australian history. Yet museums throughout Australia, and in particular the National Museum of Australia, which are charged with the task of telling these stories, struggle to find appropriate material means to do so: the history which shaped Australian museum collections and the history which shaped contemporary Aboriginal communities do not neatly converge. This research reflects on both. The structure of this thesis is fashioned around three distinct voices. The first of these is my own where I give an account of my engagement with the Ngarigo community from the Snowy Mountains region of New South Wales into whose contemporary reality and history I am drawn. This reflexive narrative also provides the means for consideration of the complex and sometimes confronting research process as it unfolds in the field. Stories rather than objects were central to the interests of the community participants and it was a story, or rather a series of stories, which I felt would best serve the thorny conjunction of politics, history and representation at the core of this project. Story is also the central method in the second voice of this work, that of the historical narrative. Here the plot centres not so much on reflection as on reconstruction of a Ngarigo family history. It is this voice that provides a powerful juxtaposition between the reality of lived lives and the constructions of Aboriginality emanating from both the academy and from within institutions of popular culture such as museums. The third voice of the thesis offers an analytical examination of the ideas underpinning the conceptual and historical elements out of which a museum is constructed. In this way I explore how the processes which have constituted the museum might be re-configured to accommodate the particularities of Aboriginal social history.},

  abstract = {This thesis argues that video games present players with an empathetic perspective of history, particularly when considering experience of war. By examining current ideas of public history and extending these to include the medium of video games, I have been able to show how video games can be used to educate the public in non-academic settings in much the same way historical film is used. I have drawn academic scholarship from a number of disciplines and have married this together with two case studies in order to support my hypothesis. Ubisoft Montpellier's Valiant Hearts: The Great War (2014) and 11bit Studios' This War of Mine (2014) can both be seen as games which aim specifically to educate their players about wartime experiences and the reality of war. Valiant Hearts: The Great War explores how the Great War (1914-1918) affected a variety of historical figures across gender and nationality, and demonstrates the hardships of the conflict through an individualised and emotive experience. With simple gameplay and cartoon-style graphics Valiant Hearts: The Great War reaches a large variety of audiences. In contrast, This War of Mine is a dark, gritty and uncompromising depiction of life in a war-torn city, based on experiences during the Siege of Sarajevo. This War of Mine has been developed to force players to question what it would be like if a civil war began in their country},

Beginning in 1956 with the launch of television in Sydney, Australia's largest television market, it maps the evolution of programming genres within the broad fields of information (news, current affairs, religion, sport and children's programming) and entertainment (light entertainment, drama and reality TV). In doing so, it reveals not a consistent process of development, but rather, one that is predominantly cyclical. Sydney, and indeed, Australian television are part of an international cultural system. By tracing broad, global trends through the prism of Sydney's commercial television in particular categories, the thesis provides insights into changes in the production and distribution, and to a lesser extent the reception, of Sydney television programming against a wider canvas.},

Although, it was not until the mid-1980s that historians began to examine the experiences of women during the Holocaust by using female-authored survivor accounts. By doing so, these academics successfully reinserted the experiences of women into the historical narrative of the Holocaust. However, very few of these scholars have decided to make female-authored survivor accounts the focus of their research. This study will examine three life narratives authored by Jewish female survivors of the Holocaust who all immigrated to Australia between 1948 and 1950. These women's accounts will be examined using a life history approach- which will see the accounts they give of the Holocaust examined alongside their accounts of their pre-war and post-war lives. By examining these women's accounts as whole texts, this study reveals the complex and varied ways in which these three women have constructed their memories of the past in the present, and how their Holocaust experiences and present role as a survivor of the Holocaust has shaped their life narratives.},

  abstract = {William Stanley Jevons (1835-1882) was a nineteenth century economist. His early life in Australia (1854-59) altered his life trajectory and forged a social scientist. Many notable scholars have insinuated the importance of Jevons' time in Australia, including John Maynard Keynes (1936), but how this formation of his focus in political economy was undertaken, and how his colonial activities actually constituted his `turn', has not fully been analysed with respect to his historical, intellectual or social context. Trained in chemistry, and working at the Sydney Mint, Jevons' interests expanded wider, and were expressed in the colonial publications of the time. He published meteorological recordings, participated in the newspaper railway debates, and conducted a social survey of late-1850s Sydney. Through this participation in, and exposure to, the colonial political economy of New South Wales, Jevons would come to acquire and express a profound interest in the social science of the colony. The colonial activities of writing, and his private reflections demonstrate the maturation of a man, and his development valuable skillsets. His sinecure position at the Sydney Mint granted him the ability to deeply reflect and acquire a visceral social liberalism, which altered his trajectory, and made him a more devoted social thinker. Without this time in Australia, Jevons' transition to a focus in political economy, may not have happened. The major agent of change during this period was his social liberalism. This thesis, therefore, argues that the mid-nineteenth century context was significant to Jevons' transition towards becoming an economist.},

Newspaper material is also employed to further explore attitudes towards terrorism throughout the examined period, and how terrorism coverage was framed. In addition to examining reports and editorials, this thesis also examines printed letters to the editor, feature articles, and the response (within reportage) from major figures within the Australian political and security fields. This examination finds that, in reporting on and discussing terrorism, the selected newspapers frequently emphasised the facets of ethnicity, geographic distance, and 'otherness'. Terrorism was framed as an activity carried out by foreign agents in response to events occurring outside of and distant from Australia, and coverage frequently conflated terror with 'ethnic violence', a trend which grew in prevalence from the 1980s onwards. Additionally, major political and security sources were rarely questioned on their claims regarding terrorism, with newspapers often reporting their statements uncritically.},

  abstract = {Terrorism and atrocities have scarred the public memory in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. Three atrocities, the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, the 1996 massacre at Port Arthur Historic Site in Tasmania, Australia, and the 2002 Bali bombings, had a significant impact on the communities they most affected. How did the differing governments and communities at these sites respond to the sudden loss of life? How were the competing agendas of these groups managed ? Are there shared and distinctive characteristics in the memorialisation of atrocitites across these countries at the turn of the millenium? In responding to these questions, this study analyses cultural differences in memorialisation at contemporary atrocity sites. It examines the differing responses at the case study sites to the planning and the timing of memorials, the engagement of those affected, the memorial designs and the management of the memorials, including tributes. It is an original comparative study of contemporary memorialisation by a heritage professional directly involved in the management of memorials at contemporary atrocity sites. The original research includes the identification of the role the internet in contemporary memorialisation, an in-depth analysis of the memorialisation of the 1996 massacre at Port Arthur Historic Site, and the memorialisation in Bali and across Australia of the 2002 Bali bombings. It extends the current scholarship on the memorialisation of the Oklahoma City bombing through identifying the impact of the internet in the memorialisation and in the timeframe of the analysis through to the 15th anniversary in 2010. The comparative analysis of the management of tributes at all the sites identified issues not previously considered in Australian scholarship: that tributes and the response to them is part of the memorialisation and management of contemporary atrocity sites. A combined research method based on an interpretive social science approach was adopted. A range of methodogies were used, including literature reviews, analysis of electronic material, site visits, unstructured in-depth interviews, and participant-observation at memorial services. Studies on history, memory and memorialisation provided the framework for my analysis and led to an original proposal, that all three sites have shared histories of the memorialisation of war and `missing' memorialisation. These shared histories, I argue, strengthened the justification for this comparative study. This comparative study identified differences across the case study countries in the designs of the built memorials, in legislation enacted after the atrocities, the responses to the perpetrators, the marking of anniversaries, and in the management of tributes left at the sites. These differences highlight the cultural divide that exists in contemporary memorialisation. Issues identified for future research include the impact of the internet and electronic social networking sites on memorialisation, and how these sites will be captured and stored for future heritage professionals and researchers. Scope also exists for further comparative global studies: on legislative responses to contemporary atrocities, and on the differing responses of communities and governments to tributes, including teddy bears and T-shirts, left at memorials and contemporary atrocity sites.},

We argue that despite methodological differences between History and Futures Studies, there is great potential for collaboration.

This schematic reveals that there are three main ways scholars think about the future: by responding to concerns about the future, by envisaging the future, and by attempting to influence the future. We then examine historical thinkers who have either opposed or endorsed thinking about the future. Our findings suggest that despite a dominant attitude within History that historians should not engage in future-thought, some significant historical thinkers have held the opposite attitude. Finally, we use three World Environmental History books as case studies of a historical genre, which we argue is particularly well suited to future-thought. We conclude that by enlarging the spatial, temporal, and disciplinary scopes of historical thinking, historians are better positioned to respond to, envisage, and influence the future.},

It traces the police's shift to community policing as it coincided with what sociologist Nikolas Rose terms 'advanced liberalism' in the late 20th century. By combining Rose's analytics of government with the emphases of cultural history, this thesis focuses on the way the turn to liaison shifted meanings and relations between the police and gay community. It shows that liaison, a concept epitomized by the Police Gay Liaison Group (1984) and Gay and Lesbian Liaison Officers (1990), involved an expansive set of relations outside of conceptions of the police as oppressors and gay and lesbian people as victims. It argues that this relationship of liaison was dynamic and contested and involved both state and non-state actors in the government of gay and lesbian citizens. Liaison regarding Mardi Gras demonstrated that the police and gay community were reimagined and repositioned by neoliberal mechanisms for performance review. The government of violence during this period highlighted how liaison and anti-violence campaigns attempted to responsibilize citizens, while community organisations made demands of the police for more services and support.},

This paper attempts to show how the temporality of the landscape may be understood by way of a ?dwelling perspective? that sets out from the premise of people's active, perceptual engagement in the world. The meaning of ?landscape? is clarified by contrast to the concepts of land, nature and space. The notion of ?taskscape? is introduced to denote a pattern of dwelling activities, and the intrinsic temporality of the taskscape is shown to lie in its rhythmic interrelations or patterns of resonance. By considering how taskscape relates to landscape, the distinction between them is ultimately dissolved, and the landscape itself is shown to be fundamentally temporal. Some concrete illustrations of these arguments are drawn from a painting by Bruegel, The Harvesters.}

Canberra's lesbian feminist community took longer to develop than many of its larger urban counterparts, not fully emerging until the late 1970s. "'She Gave Me That Look": a history of lesbian (feminism) in Canberra, 1965-84' traces the origins of that community and explores what it was like to come out as a lesbian during that period. This history draws on documentary sources and a series of interviews I conducted in 1994 with eight women about their lesbian experiences between 1965 and 1984. These women were not involved in the formative years of either women's liberation or gay liberation, coming to feminism well after the emergence of both movements. Their journeys towards, and experiences of, lesbian feminist community in Canberra offer a different perspective to our understanding of this unique period in the history of twentieth-century Australia. 'She Gave Me That Look' builds on existing gay, lesbian and feminist histories; explores the different methodological approaches employed in the production of such histories; and focuses in particular on the implications involved in including oral testimony in the writing of lesbian history in Australia.},

This variation is explained by a model of path?dependent memory work that is sensitive to how previous memory struggles enable and constrain subsequent uses of historical figures. Specifically, previous struggles produce distinct reputational trajectories that condition the potential utility of different modes of memory work. The cases illustrate two reputational trajectories, which are situated within a broader field of mnemonic possibilities. This article offers a provisional baseline for comparing contested memory projects and supplies a framework for analyzing the opportunities and constraints by which reputational trajectories condition memory work. It builds on a recent processual emphasis in the collective memory literature and suggests that the contentious politics literature needs to historicize its conception of culture and take seriously the operation of constraints on symbolic work.}

  title = {Irish Lives in the {{British Caribbean}}: Engaging with {{Empire}} in the {{Revolutionary Era}}},
  author = {{Jennifer A. McLaren}},
  year = {2018},
  address = {{Sydney, Australia}},
  abstract = {This thesis examines the Irish experience of empire in the British Caribbean during the Revolutionary Era by means of ten individual biographies of Irish sojourners. The thesis builds upon Irish historiography which addresses Ireland's place in the British Empire, and also seeks a place within British imperial historiography, which has often neglected the role of Irish people in the Empire. Each chapter focuses on a separate social sphere\textemdash the Military, Commerce, Administration and Humanitarianism, and includes profiles of non-elite men. The thesis explores the relationship between the men's Irish identities and the imperial structures within which they fashioned their Caribbean lives. For most, a connection with Ireland was important, but as the men were involved in an array of imperial projects, their Irish identity was just one of a number of interlocking cultural spaces they inhabited. The thesis interrogates how biography enables the historian to advance an argument about the past and suggests that combining a spatial approach with biography can provide thorough, multi-dimensional contextualisation. The thesis adapts the geographer David Harvey's spatial model and analyses the absolute, relative and relational spaces the sojourners inhabited, and the tensions within and between those spaces. A close study of the spaces the men inhabited, the networks and exchanges that shaped their lives, and the internal spaces of their ideas and emotions, produces a nuanced understanding of the imperial world in which they lived, and their experience of empire. The Irish sojourners navigated family, mercantile and administrative networks, as well as broader British and trans-imperial connections in the region. Although not exclusively Irish characteristics, the men in this thesis shared a tenacious nature and the ability to withstand conflict. Many pursued trans-imperial opportunities and engaged with more than one empire simultaneously. Their experiences confirm the porous nature of imperial boundaries in the region, the contingent and varied experience of imperial rule, and the asymmetries of power that existed across different sites in the British Caribbean.},

  abstract = {This thesis examines the City of Grafton in New South Wales from its creation to the present day within the context of the Clarence River valley and within the wider region. It investigates and analyses Grafton's changing service role and its relationships with evolving rural land uses in its hinterland. Grafton's early start was coupled with locational advantages. It was the first settlement to emerge on what was then a relatively easy-to-navigate river within a wide valley flourishing from initial development for timber, livestock or crops. This ensured it quickly became the regional centre providing retail, wholesale, professional and administrative services. Growth was followed by the gradual dilution and loss of its regional eminence. Particular emphasis has been given to the period from 1859 to 1885 when Grafton evolved from a rough timber port to a city with all the infrastructure of a city as well as formal declaration as a `City'. This is charted using various measures such as population in comparison with rival urban settlements, legal records and, most pertinently, banking records that demonstrate and define its loss of importance. A series of different products were produced in turn within its hinterland each of them fuelling a boom in Grafton as it rushed to serve the needs of the new market for specialised goods, whether it be axes and saws, livestock fencing, mining tools or cream separators. But as each new economic activity or crop reached the limits of possible growth or lost markets, entrepreneurs and investment shifted to areas with available land and greater potential. Grafton's reach into its hinterland was eroded when rival settlements were established within the ambit of its former domain. Once they grew into major towns, Grafton lost momentum. Rival centres Lismore and Coffs Harbour have since emerged as competing regional centres within the hinterland that was once Grafton's alone. The history presented in this thesis is not just regional in nature. It commenced simultaneously as a history commissioned by the Clarence Valley Council in 2007 to mark the sesqui-centenary of municipal incorporation of Grafton, one of the earliest municipalities gazetted in NSW in 1859. The place of commissioned history in Australian regional history is treated in the introduction.},

  author = {Kass, Dorothy},
  year = {2015},
  address = {{Sydney, Australia}},
  abstract = {Nature study was a new subject introduced to school curricula throughout the English speaking world in the 1890s and 1900s. As part of "New Education", the subject was supported by theoretical and practical literature which informed "the nature study idea". Nature study introduced plant, animal, and geological studies to children, with observation, active learning, questioning and reasoning replacing older methods. This thesis analyses the nature study idea: its distinctive definition, the contexts of its formulation, its ambitious aims, its inclusion in curricula and its practice in the classroom. I argue that nature study was a significant component of educational reform in New South Wales. Research additionally addressed the extent to which the nature study idea represented, responded to and influenced concern about the environment. I argue that nature study supported multiple outcomes and that one of these was a conservation ethic. Advocates in New South Wales welcomed the subject as education for conservation and preservation. Despite its prominence within educational reform, nature study has received little attention from educational historians. Similarly, despite its concern with the natural world, the human relationship with nature, and the way in which nature was presented to children, the subject has received little attention from environmental historians. Recently historians have addressed this gap for the United States, their work indicating the need for studies in other countries. As a history of nature study in New South Wales, the thesis is a contribution to both educational and environmental history. Essentially this is the history of an idea and as such insights and methodologies of intellectual history proved valuable in researching texts and contexts of nature study. The nature study idea was an idea in transit, extending geographically, modified by exchange, interacting with other ideas about nature, adapting in practice, and changing over time. A variety of primary source material, much of which has been rarely consulted, informed this history of the nature study idea in New South Wales.},

  abstract = {In 1984 the Quarantine Station North Head \textendash{} the oldest, largest and longest serving station in Australia - was closed and handed over to the New South Wales Government. In the following years the material degradation of the site threatened its survival, despite the promise of government funds to conserve its heritage value. After the site was leased to the heritage tourism group Mawland Hotel Management in 2006, it re-emerged as QSTATION, a retreat and conference facility where, via interactive experiences from dramatic performances and ghost tours, visitors could pay to learn something of the cultural and historical significance of the site. Packaged for public consumption and Mawland's financial viability, the history of the station was compromised. Sandwiched between a ghoulish nineteenth century past which had little relevance to the station as a place of protection and work on the one hand, and a broader historiographical meta-narrative linking quarantine to policies, particularly in Australia and the Asia-pacific region, of restrictive immigration, nationhood, and white Australia, the twentieth century story, particularly the human face of quarantine is lost. This is exacerbated by the view that the station was in complete decline following the drop in maritime quarantines after the mid-1930s. Yet the twentieth century history of the site is a rich story of continued protective activity from the threat of disease, effective disinfection of imported goods and provision of temporary accommodation for diverse groups affected by war, natural disaster and immigration policies. This thesis aims to recover the twentieth century story by focussing on the history of the station as a history of place which allows us to consider the human face of quarantine in the built environment. Far from a ghostly site, the station was place of work, life and death, of shelter and refuge against the backdrop of some of the most important social and political changes in the nation's twentieth century history.},

The first is to establish the close historical and ideological relationship between the construction of nation-states, the development of the profession of history, and the emergence of modern schooling systems, all of which were evolving during the ``long nineteenth century'' in Europe. The focus is particularly on history education given its citizen-shaping agenda of forging national identity and shaping historical consciousness. The second aim is to reanimate debates about the role of history education today. This proceeds by arguing that a shift in the experience and understanding of temporality which has occurred in the post-Cold War era has triggered a crisis of legitimacy for the nation-state, which has generated two related responses in Western democratic nation-states since 1989: an increased reflection and attachment to national identity and an impetus to reckon with the problematic past. Here, history education has come to be positioned as both a prominent target of memory contests, as well as a solution and tool of justice and reconciliation, and a means by which to regenerate the nation-state amidst a crisis of legitimacy precipitated by the lack of recourse to an unproblematic national past.},

To explore this, the article draws on examples from Australia where scholars have been extending the framework of transitional justice in order to better address the structural nature of injustice in settler states. By investigating the uses of temporality and historicization in history education, it concludes that while disciplinary models might contribute to the popular theses of transitional justice by encouraging students to emulate the skills of the historian, these models would likely work to strengthen rather than challenge the legitimacy of the Australian settler state. Therefore, any attempts to align history education with reconciliation in Australia will require a rethinking of current disciplinary models.},

Evidence indicates that inroads can be made to reduce these inequalities by better understanding social and cultural determinants of health, applying holistic notions of health and developing less rigid definitions of wellbeing. The following article draws on qualitative research on Victorian Aboriginal peoples' relationship to their traditional land (known as Country) and its link to wellbeing, in an attempt to tackle this. Concepts of wellbeing, Country and nature have also been reviewed to gain an understanding of this relationship. An exploratory framework has been developed to understand this phenomenon focusing on positive (e.g., ancestry and partnerships) and negative (e.g., destruction of Country and racism) factors contributing to Aboriginal peoples' health. The outcome is an explanation of how Country is a fundamental component of Aboriginal Victorian peoples' wellbeing and the framework articulates the forces that impact positively and negatively on this duality. This review is critical to improving not only Aboriginal peoples' health but also the capacity of all humanity to deal with environmental issues like disconnection from nature and urbanisation.},

Engaging with anthropological work on kinship, relatedness and remembrance and with recent sociological work on identity and affinity, this article explores how family history as a creative and imaginative memory and kinship practice is simultaneously used to map affinities and connectedness, enact relatedness, and produce self-identity. It argues that examining the role of genealogy and the genealogical imaginary reveals that conventional as well as non-conventional kinship produces partial and insecure identities.

People of British descent in other dominions experienced a similar dilemma \textemdash{} a phenomenon historians have been slow to explore in comparative terms. Flags are the most obvious markers of nationality. They are at the centre of this thesis, which explores Australians' negotiation of the double loyalty in the first fifty years of federation. The Union Jack was a powerful national symbol, representing the might of the British, whether in Empire or Britain, but more particularly the power of England and its liberal political traditions. Dominated by the cross of St George, the warrior patron saint of England, the Union Jack ultimately symbolised English ethnicity and Protestantism. By contrast, the Australian ensigns were ambiguous national symbols. Designed shortly after federation, with the Union Jack in the place of honour in the upper hoist, they were both colonial and national. Not until 1953 did legislation establish unequivocally which ensign was Australia's national flag. Such ambiguity makes flags and the conflict they provoked useful markers of Australians' changing perceptions of nationality, especially in the wider imperial context as other dominions struggled with a similar dilemma. Schools, particularly State schools, provide a particularly appropriate focus for this study. Through them the thesis explains why Australians were reluctant to use an Australian flag, and why their reluctance varied from State to State.},

Since the first pastoralists displaced Aboriginal land owners in the Tumut region, the country has been shaped by successive waves of occupation and land use. Each time a new land use industry was imposed on the country, the knowledge base of previous occupants was devalued, and the country once again managed without a knowledge of its history. I explore the characteristics of local environmental knowledge in order to understand how it may be tapped by new land managers. In doing so, I analyse the subjective nature of local people's memories as well as the information resource which they contain. By drawing on local knowledge, and contextualising it with reference to scientific and historical sources, it is possible to construct a more detailed picture of how a particular region has changed over time. The environmental impact of various land uses can be better understood and the social impact also becomes clearer.},

Aboriginal heritage and history, like Australian history since 1788, has never been static. It has been in a continual process of adaptation and evolution. The case study and research undertaken in Wyndham, Western Australia was designed to demonstrate on a small, local scale how Aboriginal history and heritage has evolved and endured. Aboriginal heritage is associated with the distant past, but it is also about the 19th and 20th Centuries, and about yesterday and today. Interviews were designed to facilitate a dialogue between members of the Wyndham Aboriginal community and the researcher, to expose the false paradigm symbolised by the rejection of the Aboriginal heritage claim associated with the Cyprus-Hellene Club (a relatively contemporary building) and to gain a better understanding of one group's views of their history and heritage, a heritage that proved to be firmly grounded in the past, and in a modern, geographical sense of place. There is an Aboriginal history and heritage, very much alive in the minds of the Aboriginal community in and around what many might incorrectly think of as 'Whitefella' Wyndham. It is, in reality, just Wyndham, a site with an indigenous and a non-indigenous heritage. It is a place where two histories - indigenous and non-indigenous, meet with the interaction of cultures. However the Aboriginal history of the area needs to be acknowledged before the creation of a 'shared' history can be considered.},

These discussions often mention contemporary debates amongst medical men and the laity regarding the best treatment, but the influence of medical climatology in deciding where medical facilities should be placed is often overlooked. The first sanatorium in the Colony of Victoria had two branches: Echuca and Mount Macedon. These two locations differ in terms of altitude, the surrounding forest and meteorological variation. Yet, both sites were considered suitable at the time for the location of a sanatorium, possibly due to the health-promoting and aesthetic aspects of nearby eucalypt forests. This article explores why they may at first modernly appear to be substantially different locations, but contemporary medical climatology emphasised their similarities.},

  abstract = {Whilst the fortunes of wealthy squatters and politicians have been traced in detail through official sources, the fate of `ordinary' settlers on the Darling Downs has been somewhat overlooked. The concerns of one small community are addressed here, mainly through the `unofficial' sources of knowledge that were identified by the British historian, Raphael Samuel. These include oral accounts and written memoirs from former residents, placename origins and family and community histories. An analysis of the placenames given by explorers, squatters, surveyors and ordinary settlers during the 19th century sheds new light on the concerns of the first Europeans on the Darling Downs, and provides a background to the study of the Nandi/Kupunn/Broadwater district and its community. The residents themselves describe life during the early days of the 20th century, on both the dominant freehold estate, Loudoun, and on the small selections nearby. Struggles with the environment, and the hardships of two World Wars and the Great Depression are recounted from the viewpoint of the ordinary resident in a close-knit and interdependent farming community. The effects of the post World War II era, which saw extensive land clearing, the fragmentation of the community and the intrusion of agribusiness interests, are also outlined. The personal accounts are enhanced by a collection of photographs from the 1870s through to the present day, and a selection of maps. The memoirs of ordinary people are underpinned by official records and newspaper accounts, and can be set in the established historical framework. The personal experiences of settlers in that one small community help to facilitate a deeper understanding of rural Australia, as it is today, and its development through many generations.},

We describe practices associated with dealing with inherited family archives; the creation of new artifacts (such as scrapbooks and collections of letters) out of repurposed archived materials; and the recording of one's memoirs. Our analysis leads us to emphasise a distinction between ``personal'' memory and memory ``for family,'' noting that although memory is used in the construction of a sense of one's own history, and in enabling personal reflection on the past, the work that is bound up with processing archives and producing new artifacts is heavily influenced by a desire to make them accessible and relevant to children and grandchildren, both now and in the future. The tending to, and crafting of, these materials can be understood as a means of creating a ``joint'' past and reinforcing a wider family narrative. We conclude that through these practices, memory is used a resource for self but also for future family life.},

Deindustrialization had dramatic effects on those workers and their communities, but its longterm effects continue to ripple through working-class culture. Economic restructuring changed the experience of work, disrupted people's sense of self, reshaped local landscapes, and redefined community identities and expectations. Through it all, working-class writers have told stories that reflect the importance of memory and the struggle to imagine a different future. These stories make clear that the social costs of deindustrialization affect not only those who lost their jobs but also their children, their communities, and American culture.Through analysis of poetry, fiction, creative nonfiction, film, and drama,The Half-Life of Deindustrializationshows why people and communities cannot simply "get over" the losses of economic restructuring. The past provides inspiration and strength for working-class people, even as the contrast between past and present highlights what has been lost in the service economy. The memory of productive labor and stable, proud working-class communities shapes how people respond to contemporary economic, social, and political issues. These stories can help us understand the resentment, frustration, pride, and persistence of the American working class.},

  abstract = {This thesis analyses the ways that some colonial women achieved a measure of personal autonomy by engaging in an adulterous affair. It argues that despite entrenched structural inequalities, the adulterous woman was able to exercise agency in the context of her infidelity. Through an analysis of four cases tried by jury in which a husband sued for divorce on the ground of his wife's adultery, I explore how social class influenced women's capacity for agency. Using documentary evidence taken from the Supreme Court archives and the colonial press of 1873-1881, I suggest that even the powerless and disempowered can at times act with intentionality and autonomy, and that infidelity provided some women with a space in which to resist and challenge their oppression. However, exploring the interaction of social class with gender reveals that this resistance took very different forms according to the individuals material circumstances and position in society. Each of the four women here did indeed march to the beat of her own drum, but whilst facing an economic, political and legal disempowerment that severely hampered her efforts.},

Results The Indigenous perspective proposed that spiritual well-being is founded in The Dreaming, informs everyday relationships and can impact on health. The non-Indigenous perspective suggested that spiritual well-being is shaped by culture and religion, is of increased importance as one ages, and can improve coping and resilience stressors.

  abstract = {NO FULL TEXT AVAILABLE. Access is restricted indefinitely. ----- This non-traditional thesis explores the archive of Aboriginal storyteller and writer Pauline McLeod and my attempts to understand her as revealed by her writing. It also explores some of the theoretical bases I used in the creation of her biography entitled A Lonely Business: the biography of Pauline McLeod from this material, and presents two excerpts from it.  Pauline was born in 1959 in New South Wales, Australia, and was taken from her mother's care when she was very young. She was then raised by a German foster family where she was exposed to abuse. After a reunion with her natural family at the age of 26, she had little contact with her foster family. Until her death in 2003, Pauline wrote in many genres including diaries, letters, plays, poems, fictional short stories and stories dealing with personal reminiscence and the Stolen Generation. I have subsequently assembled her life story from her archive, consisting almost entirely of her own words. Many other stories are now emerging written by people with similar experiences to Pauline, however, few are based on material that was written contemporaneously, as hers is.  In my thesis I examine some of the themes which emerge from Pauline's material including childhood and family, removal, reunion, mental health, education, stories and Pauline's positioning as a woman. Pauline also used the terms `Aboriginal' and `culture' frequently and an examination of her conceptualisation of them is also made. The thesis also examines the methodology used to create Pauline's biography as a single cohesive narrative derived from many fragments. I also explore who the work is `aimed' at; the implications of writing outside my own culture and gender; what implications arise if one member of a nonmainstream culture is seen as representative of the entire experience of that culture; specific issues regarding writing Australian Aboriginality; the implications of structuring the account in a biographical format; how I made choices to `include' myself within the work in order to bring a sense of `transparency' and reflexivity to it, and what kind of editing was used on Pauline's words - and why the choice was made to edit them at all.  'Two chapters from A Lonely Business in its most recent draft are included herein to illustrate the arguments I present within the body of the thesis and also to give a sense of Pauline as a writer.},

  abstract = {This thesis is a consideration of zines and zine practices, and their impact on how we understand archives. I argue that to define zines we need to look past the materiality of the publication, and consider a broader set of practices. Considering zines as practices enables different, and not necessarily linear, approaches to archives. I demonstrate that zines have a queer sensibility, and this `zine' sensibility can disrupt linear repro-time and space (per Halberstam) and ways of making archives.  This thesis asks `what impact do zine practices have on how archives are understood and imagined?' and addresses this question through the consideration of a series of spatial and temporal examples. These examples include formal collecting institutions, bedrooms, do-it-yourself archives in social centres and cafes, scholarly publications and zine anthologies.  A secondary point of investigation asks `how do specific sites of non-normative research such as zines inform research practice, and what form can this research take?' This question is addressed by employing a queer approach to methodology motivated by zine practices; I use scavenger techniques to build a body of knowledge that includes narratives, interviews, zines, gossip and academic texts.  To queer archives disrupts normalised understandings of memory and histories, challenging assumed temporalities and reimagining the fixed space of `the archive'. Zines and zine practices unsettle assumptions of archival spaces, and through this archives can be reimagined as generative and productive sites of practice and knowledge, rather than static sites of fact and record.},

As a result, religious ideology and social action have sometimes been seen as syncretic, raising questions about how Yolngu understand and experience Christian conversion, encounter and revelation. I argue that Yolngu spiritual experiences emerge from the sentiments associated with ancestral places that act as emotive sites for remapping an ancestral aesthetic as Christian experience. The resultant emotional and spiritual synchronicity underlies a Yolngu Christianity that is corporeal and abstracted, negotiated and strategic, practical and experiential.},

But despite their state of decline, these derelict sites remain vitally connected with the urban landscapes that surround them. In this enlightening new book, Alice Mah explores the experiences of urban decline and post-industrial change in three different community contexts: Niagara Falls, Canada/USA; Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK; and Ivanovo, Russia. Employing a unique methodological approach that combines ethnographic, spatial, and documentary methods, Mah draws on international comparisons of the landscapes and legacies of industrial ruination over the past forty years. Through this, she foregrounds the complex challenges of living with prolonged uncertainty and deprivation amidst socioeconomic change. This rich comparative study makes an essential contribution to far-reaching debates about the decline of manufacturing, regeneration, and identity, and will have important implications for urban theory and policy.}

It focuses on how the community as a whole, and as individuals, exert agency and maintain their values and priorities when situated within larger, sometimes more powerful, structures and frameworks that differ from their own. Through the prism of art, the research examines the community's engagement with and value of the Warmun Community Collection, their history of adjustment, the unofficial roles of the Warmun Art Centre and how the Warmun Art Centre supports and enables informal learning. The thesis connects these four themes through a socio-historical analysis of the experiences of Warrmarn people, ethnographic and visual descriptions of their actions and a visual examination of the manifestations of their actions\textemdash objects of creative practice or, artworks. In doing so, the thesis reveals several overlapping matters: it tracks the development of a museum in an Aboriginal community; it brings to light the hidden roles of the Warmun Art Centre; it contributes to the developing field of informal learning; it reveals how people express agency in daily life; it unveils the proprietorial relationship people have with objects; and finally, it lays bare the purpose, use and interpretations of objects, which has at times made Warmun residents, and their sites of cultural production, tangential to the objects they make. The research finds that Warrmarn people live their heritage rather than curate their past.},

  address = {{Sydney}},
  abstract = {In the early twentieth century, modernisation was underway in Australia. The social and political ruptures characteristic of that process resulted in many feeling the need for continuity between the past and the present. In New South Wales the desire for stability and continuity was actively represented through efforts to prevent the demolition a variety of historic places that held communal memories. The preservation of historic buildings began with pressure from local groups maintaining a sense of place, but took on a nationalist cast, when, in a climate of rising nationalism, environmental development began to remove buildings significant to powerful social groups and to a wider range of communities. This thesis investigates the history of the practice of preserving historic buildings in New South Wales from 1900 to the 1950s. It particularly pays attention to the positioning of historians within the emerging building-preservation movement, and takes note of historic preservation's relationship to the formation of national identities and to the diverse changes wrought by modernity on society and culture. From the early years of the twentieth century, amateur and then professional historians were positioned as experts and leaders in Australian history. The brief included active promotion of historic preservation. Thus began the transformation of buildings into historic monuments, that is, monuments not purpose-built, but chosen from existing building stock for those shared memories and historical associations, used to connect people to communal identities, including national identities. Monumentalisation, however, transforms old buildings into structures whose attachment to identity not only emerges from memorial associations but which is also substantially visual \textendash{} that is, its role is to present as something of a spectacle. By the 1930s, at a time when modern visual technologies were producing a rising visual sensibility, many architects and artists were persuaded that some colonial buildings had aesthetic merit. Tensions arose between architectural factions on the question of preservation, as they also did within planning. Furthermore, unexplored differences between the communal meanings which architects assigned to historic buildings and those assumed by historians led to events that damaged the authority of the history profession over historic buildings. After World War II, artistic and aesthetic ideas came to dominate the emerging idea of heritage. The institutionalisation of the movement was overseen by amateur and professional groups favouring an aesthetic sensibility to the detriment of an historical approach. How and why this occurred is the subject of this work.},

Although Indigenous particularities contribute to generational conflict they are not disappearing, while Aboriginal people remain on or near the lands in which their stories are embedded. Locative traditions emphasise genealogical continuities between the living and the dead. Evangelical missionaries, however, direct spirits of the living to heaven and condemn spirits of the dead to follow Satan. One Aboriginal woman has reached a kind of resolution between God and Indigenous spirits: mamu and juwarri (spirits of the dead) are not evil spirits but sinners who will be redeemed in the Last Days.1},

  doi = {10.25911/5d611b5400f23},
  abstract = {This thesis questions how representations of the past, in particular those present in feature films, are influenced by the present in which those representations are created. There are a range of approaches to depicting the past in feature films, however, much of the scholarship in the area of film and history focuses on the manner in which single films or genres of film represent specific events or people of the past. I utilise a new approach to the examination of this form of representation of the past by examining a group of films across a range of genres. The films I am examining were all made within one historical period (the Reagan-Bush presidencies in the United States) about another period of the past, the Sixties. Identification of the influence of the present in which a representation is created on that representation requires an examination of context. The thesis focuses on three main issues within the films\textemdash sex, Vietnam and race. These areas were chosen because they were sites of change and debate during both the Sixties and the 1980s and early 1990s. I explore the depictions of sex, Vietnam and race in the archive of films examined before placing the representations within their contexts. These representations are given context in two ways. Firstly, I compare the manner in which the films depict sex, Vietnam and race in the Sixties with the way in which the other films made during the Reagan-Bush years represent the same issues. This allows the identification of representations which are peculiar to the Sixties setting. Secondly, I examine the media and political debates about sex, Vietnam and race from the Reagan-Bush years. Comparing the political and media debates from the 1980s and early 1990s with the representations within the films set in the Sixties allows for consideration of the manner in which the representation of the Sixties has been affected by the politics of the present at the time of their creation. I find that while the representations of the past are affected in different ways by the present, there is a clear relationship between the manner in which the Sixties is depicted within the films and the political debates and media representations of the 1980s and early 1990s. The thesis finally questions whether the representations of the Sixties within the films could be considered to be collective memory. To do so, I establish a theoretical framework for collective memory. I then consider what I have discovered about the representations within the films against this framework. The thesis concludes that while there is no single approach to representation which could be applied to all the films, the representations within the films could generally be considered to fit within the theoretical understanding of collective memory.},

Design: Qualitative, open-ended interviews, audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and thematically analysed. Participants: There were a total of 72 interviews completed with Indigenous patients (n = 10), Indigenous caregivers (n = 19), Indigenous and non-Indigenous health care workers (n = 41), and interpreters (n = 2). Results: The findings provide a clear articulation of the wish of Aboriginal people from rural and remote areas to die at home connected to land and family. Strong cultural reasons were given for this preference, including the strong connection with land and community, a belief in `death country', the importance of passing on sacred knowledge to the appropriate family member, the significance of ensuring that the dying individual's `animal spirit' is able to return to the land, and the imperative that the `right person' in the family network is available to provide the care. Conclusion: The strong wish to die at home informs the importance of building up local health and palliative care services and avoiding, where possible, the need for relocation for health care to the major metropolitan hospitals during end-of-life care.},

  abstract = {This thesis considers how families engaged with memory-making and with the state in the aftermath of the Great War, focusing on engagement between Australian families and the Australian War Memorial in the interwar period. In Australia, the process of writing the official histories of the Great War began soon after the Armistice, drawing from the letters, diaries, and documents of those who had experienced the conflict. From 1927 to the mid-1930s, the Memorial actively reached out to families whom it was believed might hold records of use to this work. This thesis is based in the archives of the Memorial, and is focused on the records of correspondence between families and the institution in response to this request for donations. 2454 enquiries were directed to the next-of-kin of war dead. While most of the recipients of these donation requests had no direct experience of the conflict, they remained profoundly affected by its results. This series of communication presents a body of work that explores the process of transition from "memory" to "history", incorporating archival histories, memory studies, and material culture. This research considers the role of this file series as an archival resource, but also as testimony to the generational impact of loss. Respondents were conscious that donated records would continue to be used by future generations after the conflict had left living memory. Many of those contacted failed to respond, or declined to donate, but their influence lingers in the spaces of the Memorial. The experiences of these families are embedded in the histories produced by the Memorial, and are crucial to understanding how commemoration of the Great War in Australia has evolved.},

We discuss a mentoring program run by and for Indigenous young people that is successfully impacting school retention and completion rates: The Australian Indigenous Mentoring Experience (AIME). AIME has a rule, `No Shame at AIME', with the view to minimising shame as a barrier to engaging with Western education. But is this as beneficial as might first appear? Might this erode important cultural understandings of shame necessary in Indigenous education? Instead, could shame be repositioned to better align with original cultural meanings and purposes? We philosophise about the AIME rule with Yuin Country and stories from Country along with our observational and interview data. We argue AIME does not so much `remove' shame as reposition it to better align with Aboriginal cultural educational practice, which positively impacts mentees.},

From Phar Lap's preserved remains to the Opening Ceremony of the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games; from 'Banjo' Paterson's poem "The Man from Snowy River" to the 2018 Wild Horse Heritage Bill (NSW), the notion that the horse is meaningful to Australians continues to be perpetuated. Nonetheless, the exact nature of this significance remains nebulous and imprecise, and the topic has drawn little critical attention from Australian Studies or Cultural Studies scholars. In view of this academic silence, this thesis interrogates the key narratives associated with the Australian 'horse discourse', and asks, broadly, what is the nature of the horse's significance in Australia, and what does this reveal about Australian identity? Drawing on a mixed-methods approach - including a nation-wide survey of collecting institutions, stakeholder interviews, and the analysis of literature from a diversity of fields - this research seeks to explore the foundational assumptions upon which the equine significance narrative is constructed. The thesis addresses representations of the horse from several key perspectives - as an imported cultural trope; as historically important; within the museum context; and when framed as heritage, particularly with respect to the recent brumby debates. Through these multiple entry-points, the thesis offers a considered analysis of constructions of this animal as an identity narrative. Building on anthropologist James Wertsch's notion of schematic narrative templates, I identify an Australian iteration, which I name the Underdog narrative template. The thesis argues that tales from the equine significance discourse, when underpinned by the Underdog schematic narrative template, are reinforced, becoming potent sites for the expression of nationalism. Combining this understanding with an Animal Studies framing, I argue that the significance of the horse in Australia is largely instrumental, predicated upon an inherently anthropocentric and utilitarian approach. This in turn allows it to be deployed as a symbolic construct, revealing the cultural work the horse is tasked with - in particular in mediating anxieties of belonging among white, Anglo-European Australians.},

  abstract = {The Illawarra beaches of 1900-1940 were rapidly transformed by the emergence of promenading, bathing, sunbathing and surf lifesaving. In 1900, public daylight bathing was banned. Yet, by 1940, the practice of individuals clad in skimpy bathing costumes was considered normative behaviour. Conceptualising beach-making as the complex interplay of uneven social relationships stretched across different geographical scales, this thesis uses Foucauldian discourse analysis to critically examine transformations of the social relationships that forged the Illawarra beaches as a leisure and tourism space in a range of source materials. To form a beach archive, empirical materials were gathered from bank, surf club, State Rail, Council and print media records. Discourse analysis is deployed to illustrate how the discursive structures of gender, class, race, health, beauty, fitness and settler nation worked together to naturalise the beach as a leisure and tourism place for white settler Australians. Emergent themes are discussed in four results chapters. The first examines the discursive structures that initially helped to fashion the Illawarra as a seaside resort. The second argues that understandings of the Illawarra as a seaside resort were considerably hindered by economic discourses. At this time priority was given to manufacturing over leisure and tourism activities. The third examines how sun and surf bathing both physically and socially transformed the Illawarra beaches by including or excluding certain practices and bodies. Ocean baths, changing rooms, surf club houses, reels and surfboards became commonplace. The beach became a naturalised place for physically fit, bronzed xiii bodies revealing flesh, while bathing in both the ocean and by the rays of the sun. The final chapter investigates the surf lifesaving movement in the Illawarra. The archive suggests that practices of surf lifesavers both fix and rupture arguments of the lifesaving movement as forging understandings of the beach in terms of discipline, service and nation building.},

My experience as a researcher in the Seasons for Healing project gave me an opportunity to consider this question. Using an interpretive ethnographic approach, it became evident that I needed to recognize participants as whole people, not as mere instruments on which to conduct research, and that this engagement needed to occur in a relational way. Although I was an ?outsider?, I was able to engage in dadirri, the process of listening with one?s ear but also with the heart. At the cultural interface, it was important to recognize the validity of different types of knowledge and that research should be conducted ethically and respectfully so that the interests of Indigenous communities were considered. Indeed, it was reinforced to me that there were different ways of knowing and each type of knowledge needed to be accorded validity. Respectful listening and reflective communication enabled me to experience life and culture from a different perspective and to gain insight via a different paradigm.}

Drawing on theory and research from psychology and other humanities disciplines, as well as from the authors' extensive survey data collected from over 800 amateur genealogists, the authors present the experiences of family historians, including personal insights, relationship changes, mental health benefits and ethical dilemmas. The book emphasises the motivation behind this exploration, including the need to acknowledge and tell ancestral stories, the spiritual and health-related aspects of genealogical research, the addictiveness of the detective work, the lifelong learning opportunities and the passionate desire to find lost relatives. With its focus on the role of family history in shaping personal identity and contemporary culture, this is fascinating reading for anyone studying genealogy and family history, professional genealogists and those researching their own history},

Moreover, the effect of specifically Australian landscapes is frequently understood by reference to a place's Aboriginal history or `spirit', with recognition of such places both celebrating and laying claim to the land. However, having a feeling for land is not straightforward. Although Aboriginal people often served as a synonym for the land itself and thus were considered intrinsic to much of the land's spiritual and personal value, their prior claims to its ownership also sometimes upset non-Aboriginal feelings of love for the land.},

The research found that millennial pilgrimages share much in common with the young Australian travellers of the 1990s and early-2000s, especially the nationalistic motivation to travel there. The evolution of the Anzac Dawn Service into a tightly controlled and structured event, though, has led to commercial tour companies and event organisers shaping the pilgrim experience and influencing how millennials engage with the site.},

  abstract = {Ideas of belonging, cultural identity, and social relations based on ancestral connection, blood, and primordial kinship, have a contradictory presence in cultural theory and public culture. The search for alternatives to fixed, essentialist, and exclusive ways of imagining culture and belonging has been central to recent cultural theory and cultural geography. This has involved much attention to cultural routes, mobility, and hybridity and a critique of cultural roots, fixity, and purity in response to increasing transnational flows, the experience of displaced people, racism, and ethnic fundamentalism. Yet discourses of indigeneity and new migration patterns, as well as cultural globalisation more widely, have also prompted the growth in genealogy amongst `settler' groups in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States who search for European, and often specifically Irish, roots. In this paper I explore the relationships between ideas of nation, ancestry, and diaspora. I focus on what happens when questions of nationality, ethnicity, and identity meet in the practice of ancestral research in Ireland, and begin to track the spatially differentiated cultural politics of genealogy. As the language of genealogy travels with Irish roots tourists and through electronic networks, the implications of genealogical practices and identifications can mutate so that what may be a politically regressive turn to ethnic purity and racial discourse in one context can, in another, productively unsettle older exclusive versions of belonging. For both individual and collective identities, genealogical projects can have unsettling results.},

  abstract = {This thesis examines the construction of ruling-class masculinity in the early colonial period in New South Wales. It shows how a specific form of masculinity emerged to cater for the particular demands that political and economic authority wrought on ruling-class men. Consequently, the figure of the British gentleman during this period was renegotiated and then re-enacted by these men in order to meet the uneasy and contradictory ways this masculine ideal was reshaped by these demands. By asking questions of the family and school, this thesis argues that we are able to see this renegotiation play out through two institutions that sustain \textendash{} and promote \textendash{} gendered norms and expectations. Through a close reading of the Macarthur family correspondence, this thesis demonstrates the vulnerability of the gentlemanly stereotype in the antipodes, as well as showing John Macarthur's determination to train his sons James and William in colonial manliness. This thesis also examines the role played by the King's School inParramatta in constructing ruling-class masculinity, including the ways in which it was founded and its devotion to the schooling system `godliness and good learning'. I argue that the formation of an antipodean ruling-class not only paralleled a struggle to consolidate political and economic authority, but also an explicit attempt to construct a particular form of colonial manliness.},

By reading these publications over the course of several years, I have been able to identify several trends unfolding over time, noting how popular conceptions of the technology have changed. By comparing these with work done on the history of home video in other countries, it allows for a greater understanding of what is unique to Australia's history with the VCR. Perhaps the most significant finding is that the idea of what a VCR can offer is perpetually changing. What began as a simple means to record and playback programmes from television broadcasts quickly became a key part of commercial film distribution fundamentally altered the way in which people experience their television sets. As such, a struggle for position by producers, distributors and consumers erupted, as it irrevocably changed media in Australia.},

Stanner (1979, 23\textendash 40) describes the Dreaming as pervading every aspect of life from social organization to food gathering. Not only is it the period of creation when the mythical ancestors roamed the earth, but it is also the life spirit which ties man, society and nature, both past and present, to the living now.R.M. Berndt (1980) describes the dreaming thus:The Dreaming therefore constituted a particular view of life, of the place of human beings within a preordained scheme or patterning symbolising a three-sided relationship between mythic beings, nature and people. Each was dependent on the others. People were part of nature, part of particular mythic beings, in social and personal terms.(Berndt, 1980, 14\textendash 15)Not only did traditional Aborigines believe in the Dreaming, they lived it. It is the Dreaming which provides the blueprint for life.Central to the belief in the Dreaming is the belief in the mythical beings. These beings were part human and part animal.

She knew that he had fled Poland after World War Two, that he had disappeared overnight when she was just an infant, and that his brief reappearance when she was a young adult had been a harrowing, painful ordeal. Fifty-five years after he deserted her family, Betty is determined to find out more. What drove him to abandon them, twice? What was his story? Who was Antoni Jagielski? Her search for truth takes Betty to Poland, where she unexpectedly inherits a family apartment from the half sister she never knew, a time capsule of her father's life. Sifting through photos and letters she begins to piece together a picture of her father as a Polish resistance fighter, a survivor of Auschwitz and Gusen concentration camps, an exile in post-war England, and a migrant to Australia. But the deeper she searches, the darker the revelations about her father become, as Betty is faced with disturbing truths buried within her family. Honest, compelling, and meticulously researched, The Other Side of Absence is an elegant debut memoir of resilience and strength, and of a daughter reconciling the damage that families inherit from war.},

It is a group method, involving always the collective analysis of individual written memories. It is feminist in being explicitly liberationist in its intent.

In the 19th century this supposed temporal `otherness' was often understood to be a timelessness, a total unawareness of time. This article suggests that, irrespective of any correspondence with actual indigenous beliefs, the construction of temporal difference was part of the 18th- and 19th-centuries colonial enterprise, and bore the marks of contemporary middle-class preoccupations. These preoccupations also shaped the reform of popular culture within England itself. An examination of attitudes to plebeian temporalities in England problematizes a purely transparent relationship between colonial terminology and indigenous culture. Use of the term `Dreamtime', for example, belongs to a long history of discussion about the nature of dreaming and its relationship to prophecy. Drawing connections between the marginalization of English popular belief and of Aboriginal culture lends support to recent analysis of the history of the word `Dreamtime' that has stressed its hegemonic role within a dominant language.},

They even received government encouragement to sponsor migrants. These relationships challenge the traditional view of Australian assimilation policy as resisting migrant-led initiatives.},

This paper notes some of the constraints of mainstream therapeutic methodologies and makes suggestions to ensure a therapeutic setting for both the person and therapist born from my experience as a counsellor working in government and community settings, with adults, young people and children, and in mental health, substance use and social/emotional wellbeing. What follows is an iteration of the importance of engagement and adopting a whole of life view to counselling.Findings: The ?whole of life view to mental health? as described in the 1989 National Aboriginal Health Strategy is used as a reference from which to elaborate on various counselling principles. Five key elements are discussed in relation to engagement and therapy for Indigenous Australians. To focus on the specifics of task-oriented therapy can be detrimental to the relationship between therapist and person. The role of the person in the determination of their therapeutic goals and the mannerisms of the therapist strongly influence the counselling process and its outcomes. Indigenous Australia has long emphasized the significance of the person as a part of a wider world influenced primarily by their relationships with people (specifically family and community), culture, spirituality and the environment.Conclusion: An Indigenous Australian view of the world influences the way in which Indigenous Australians interact with the world and avail themselves to it. Effective therapy is dependent on the relationship between the therapist and the person, a relationship which must be based on respect, reciprocity, accountability, humility and an appreciation of the significance of how a holistic view of the world influences one's sense of self.}

  abstract = {This studio-based research explores how painting can act as a vehicle for my reflections on the invasion and colonisation of Tasmania. The project brings together three fields of inquiry: the history of invasion and colonisation in Tasmania, contemporary politics, and the history and contemporary practice of painting. My research questions focus on exploring how aspects of each field touch and animate each other and how painting might delve into important problems of a complex, contested and violent history. Distinctively, this studio research responds to extensive reading of both primary sources such as the journals of George Robinson, and current perspectives on our contact history. The contemporary historical studies I reference include Lyndall Ryan's The Aboriginal Tasmanians, Henry Reynolds' Fate of A Free People and A History of Tasmania, Patsy Cameron's Grease and Ochre, Graeme Calder's Levee, Line and Martial Law, and James Boyce's Van Diemen's Land. In reflecting on the written record through drawing and painting in the studio, I discuss the potentials, limitations and implications of working from primary sources as compared with historical scholarship. The intersection of questions of history and painting demands my discussion of key examples of history painting: Pieter Bruegel the Elder, Jacques-Louis David, Francisco Goya, Edouard Manet, Sidney Nolan, and Gordon Bennett. These artists each developed their own methods for vividly animating significant moral narratives from their milieus. Most importantly, the sorts of compositions, aesthetics, and processes they utilise reflect each artist's relationship with their society and history. Given the evident impossibility of definitively recreating or depicting specific events from our past, I have developed a process for evoking the lived experiences of historic events while not depicting them in detail. I draw on TJ Clark's work on discuss the principles of contingency, Raphael Rubenstein on provisionality in painting, and Michael Fried's theories of absorption and embodiment as all having contributed significantly to my approach to the painting process. This exegesis tracks a period of sustained experimentation through which I develop a process contingent on a multiplicity of texts, my studio experiences, and my imagining of the events to develop a contemporary painting practice as an uncertain, open and honest engagement with the brutal realities of our past.},

  author = {Prout, Sarah},
  year = {2007},
  address = {{Sydney, Australia}},
  abstract = {This dissertation explores contemporary Aboriginal spatial practices in Yamatji country, Western Australia, within the context of rural service provision by the State government. The central themes with which it engages are a) historical and contemporary conceptualisations of Aboriginal spatialities; b) the lived experiences of Aboriginal mobilities in the region; and c) the dialectical, and often contentious, relationship between Aboriginal spatial practices and public health, housing, and education services. Drawing primarily on a range of field interviews, the thesis opens up a discursive space for examining the cultural content and hidden assumptions in constructions of 'appropriate' models of spatial mobility. In taking a policy-oriented focus, it argues that the appropriate provision of basic government services requires a shift away from overly simplistic assumptions and discourses of Aboriginal mobility. Until the often subtle practices of rendering particular Aboriginal mobilities as irrational, deviant, and/or mysterious are challenged and replaced, deep-colonising practices in rural and remote Australia will persist. --The thesis reconceptualises contemporary Aboriginal spatial practices in Yamatji country based upon an examination of dynamics and circumstances that undergird Aboriginal mobilities in the region. With this empirical focus, it argues that Aboriginal spatial practices are fashioned by the processes of procuring, cultivating and contesting a sense of security and belonging. Case study material presented suggests that two primary considerations inform these processes. A post-settlement history of contested alienation from family and country (both sources from which belonging and security were traditionally derived), and a changing engagement with mainstream social and economic institutions, have produced a context in which security and belonging are iteratively derived from a number of sources. Contemporary Aboriginal spatial practices therefore take a complex variety of forms. The thesis concludes that adopting the framework of security and belonging for interpreting contemporary Aboriginal mobilities provides a starting point for engaging more effectively and intentionally with dynamic Aboriginal spatial practices in service delivery policy and practice.},

Inspired by actor-networks and emotional geography, this thesis brings posthumanism to an Australian regional museum to study contemporary people-place interactions. Research stems from a responsive, inclusive and participatory museology. Using a museum/laboratory construct to destabilize subject/object, people/place and local/global dualisms, a participatory, performative methodology: body mapping, brings identity and place into being. This event produces new worlds beyond classification, expressive of non-representational concerns, and attentive to the senses and contemporary mobilities. Shaped by museum users as collaborators and co-constructors of embodied knowledge, these worlds challenge and enliven the museum. A viscero-spatial curatorship develops. This more-than-institutional thinking folds theory and practice to evolve the museum as a site of production. Here, mobile bodies enact global space, and interpretation becomes an emotional engagement with multiple worlds. Boundaries separating the research, collection and display of place-based identities dissolve. This emergent working practice captures local identities as human/non-human entanglements in fluid, affective transnational spaces.},

It argues that despite entrenched structural inequalities, the adulterous woman was able to exercise agency in the context of her infidelity. Through an analysis of four cases tried by jury in which a husband sued for divorce on the ground of his wife's adultery, I explore how social class influenced women's capacity for agency. Using documentary evidence taken from the Supreme Court archives and the colonial press of 1873-1881, I suggest that even the powerless and disempowered can at times act with intentionality and autonomy, and that infidelity provided some women with a space in which to resist and challenge their oppression. However, exploring the interaction of social class with gender reveals that this resistance took very different forms according to the individuals material circumstances and position in society. Each of the four women here did indeed march to the beat of her own drum, but whilst facing an economic, political and legal disempowerment that severely hampered her efforts.},

  abstract = {AbstractIn this article, the Federated Archaeological Information Management Systems (FAIMS) project presents its stocktaking activities and software development towards the creation of a comprehensive digital infrastructure for archaeologists. A National eResearch Collaboration Tools and Resources (NeCTAR)-funded initiative, the FAIMS project aims to develop tools to facilitate the creation, sharing, reuse and dissemination of high-quality digital datasets for research and cultural heritage management. FAIMS has engaged in an extensive stocktaking and liaison programme with archaeologists and related professionals, the results of which have shaped the development plans. Project development is focusing on highly customisable mobile applications for data collection, a web application for data processing, and an online repository for archiving and disseminating data, with provisions for creating semantically and technically compatible datasets embedded throughout. Data exchange using standard formats and approaches ensures that components work well together, and that new, externally developed tools can be added later. Our goal is to create a digital system that respects the current workflow of archaeological practice, improves the availability of compatible archaeological data, and delivers features that archaeologists want to use.}

  address = {{Sydney, Australia}},
  abstract = {Identity politics has long been accused of fragmenting and destabilising progressive politics,and critiques of its political effects continue unabated in light of its enduring significance. Yet, the majority of these accounts fail to historicise identity, proceeding from metaphysical or psychological definitions that flatten its effects. This thesis takes a poststructuralist approach that conceptualises identity not as some ontological pre-given but as a historically-derived discourse, and thus does not examine what it is but what it does. The aim of this thesis is thus to trace the historical emergence of this discourse in order to move current theorisations about its political effects into a more nuanced, productive avenue. To do so, it considers two social movements in Australia that are often seen as central examples of the rise of identity politics: the women's rights movement and the Aboriginal rights movement. Engaging in a close reading of the political claims made by activists involved in these movements, it traces the discourses of selfhood through which activists articulated their political demands. More specifically, it takes up the insight that the rise of the term `identity' is actually historically recent and should be understood as part of a broader historical discourse of selfhood, in order to answer the question of how identity politics works. In doing so, this thesis suggests that discourses of selfhood in the 20th century were closely tied to the knowledges being produced by the social sciences in this period, and that the discourse of identity reproduced by activists was likewise enmeshed within these logics. Analysing these political claims reveals three ways that identity politics has historically `worked': by naturalising and thus universalising the individual capacity for agency in terms of recognition, by subsequently politicising human relations as foundational to this agency, and by positing culture as necessary for the development of this agency (and likewise problematising the claim that this capacity was exclusive to Western culture). Ultimately, this demonstrates that the kinds of political claims made possible by identity politics are more extensive than existing accounts allow.},

A thorough, comprehensive and analytical literature review was conducted. The literature review explored the importance of Aboriginal Peoples' (AP) fishing cultures, and identified examples of fishing practices, ideology and sustainable philosophy, which may be beneficial in sustainably managing dwindling seafood resources. The overriding theme of Aboriginal Peoples' fishing cultures is the taking of enough fish to ease personal/community hunger, and restricted fishing based on seasons and/or stock abundance. This practice protects fish during vulnerable or important stages, such as spawning, allowing fish stocks to regenerate, and allowing fish to be caught when they are healthy and most nutritious. It is considered that the Aboriginal Peoples of Australia can contribute significant knowledge to the management of dwindling aquatic resources. Access to sacred sites and favourite fishing grounds would benefit communities, would increase the contact between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Peoples, and may assist in an interchange of sustainability information and philosophy. The world's aquatic resources are dangerously depleted. Without a significant shift in focus, this will continue. Rather than relegate the fishing cultures of Aboriginal Peoples to `histories past', we can learn valuable lessons to conserve aquatic resources, and to better understand the interconnectedness with the environment inherent in their cultures. Fishing is used as a generic term for both freshwater and marine fishing in this article.},

  author = {Shanahan, Mairead},

  abstract = {Sociologists of religion have found significant and sustained global growth amongst Pentecostal and Charismatic forms of Christianity. From this research, neo-Pentecostalism has emerged as a fruitful site for scholars to examine developments in Pentecostal and Charismatic Christianities. Despite acknowledgement of the successful global expansion of Hillsong Church, and denominational studies of COC/inc and Australian Christian Churches (formerly Australian Assemblies of God), sociologists of religion have not examined incarnations of other internationally-recognised Australian-based neo-Pentecostal churches. The present study contributes to both international and Australian Pentecostal studies through an analysis of the theology and operations of five such churches: Hillsong Church, C3 Church, Citipointe Church, Planetshakers and Influencers Church. The thesis seeks to answer the question: what are the features of theology and organisational practice that assist these churches in growing on both a local and international scale? Using a critical religious studies framework to examine materials produced by the five churches, the thesis situates the continued expansion of Australian-based expressions of neo-Pentecostalism in historical, economic, social, and cultural context. The thesis argues that Australian neo-Pentecostal churches have expanded into organisations with international reputations by responding to the conditions of late-modernity. The thesis assesses the impact of several characteristics of late-modernity\textemdash neoliberal governance, marketisation and branding, mass-communication strategies, globalisation, celebration of entrepreneurial abilities, and individualised patterns of consumerism\textemdash as significant dynamics for facilitating the global expansion of Australian-based expressions of neo-Pentecostalism. The research finds that Australian neo-Pentecostal churches actively incorporate aspects of late-modernity\textemdash specifically, consumer capitalism, globalisation, and individualism as a curated self that realises modern understandings of personal freedom\textemdash in justifying and supporting their theological underpinnings and church-branded activities. The thesis advances Australian religious studies by developing an analysis of the emergence of neo-Pentecostalism in Australia and contributes to an international body of literature that seeks to position neo-Pentecostalism within conditions of late-modernity.},

The Comorbidity Action in the North project sought to better meet the needs of local people affected by drug, alcohol and mental health comorbidity. The aim of the study focused on the needs of Aboriginal peoples and on developing a truly representative research process. A methodology evolved that best suited working with members of a marginalised Aboriginal community. This paper discusses the process of codesign of a Western methodology (participatory action research) in conjunction with the Indigenous methodologies Dadirri and Ganma. This co-design enabled an international PhD student to work respectfully with Aboriginal community members and Elders, health professionals and consumers, and non-Indigenous service providers in a drug and alcohol and mental health comorbidity project in Adelaide, South Australia. Methods: The PhD student, Aboriginal Elder mentor, Aboriginal Working Party, and supervisors (the research team) sought to co-design a methodology and applied it to address the following challenges: the PhD student was an international student with no existing relationship with local Aboriginal community members; many Aboriginal people deeply distrust Western research due to past poor practices and a lack of implementation of findings into practice; Aboriginal people often remain unheard, unacknowledged and unrecognised in research projects; drug and alcohol and mental health comorbidity experiences are often distressing for Aboriginal community members and their families; attempts to access comorbidity care often result in limited or no access; and Aboriginal community members experience acts of racism and discrimination as health professionals and consumers of health and support services. The research team considered deeply how knowledge is shared, interpreted, owned and controlled, by whom and how, within research, co-morbidity care and community settings. The PhD student was supported to co-design a methodology that was equitable, democratic, liberating and life-enhancing, with real potential to develop feasible solutions.},

But this was not the first turning point, nor the last. History is littered with critical moments, crossroads, watersheds and points of decision. Each brings a new sense of urgency, each draws renewed attention to the fate of humankind, but the moment soon passes and the urgency fades...until next time. This thesis uses the dawn of the atomic age in Australia as the inspiration for an examination, not of key moments, but of the journey that sweeps through them\textemdash{} this thing we call progress. It is a journey that carries us from past to future, from old to new; a journey where space and time exchange metaphors and meanings. But where do individual hopes fit within the march of civilisation? How are our ambitions and achievements measured alongside the growth of nations or the development of science? Progress imagines a steady passage onwards, but we know that our own journeys are circuitous and intermittent. We stop, we go back, we think ahead, we live in the past.  This thesis shifts between individual and nation, from the dreams of a disappointed poet, to the terrifying power of the atom. Traversing much of twentieth century Australia, it examines the interactions between science and the state, between knowledge and power. Where have we sought the key to progress and who has been granted authority to speak in its name? What dangers have emerged to threaten our destiny, and where have we sought protection? Answers are to be found by charting the shifting boundaries of trust and authority, participation and control, that separate science and public, citizen and state.},

  abstract = {Violence has long been an explanatory framework for the Tasmanian Black War. Over the last decade the focus has been violence over the long duree of violence in relation to the question of genocide. However, more recently Lyndall Ryan has begun to map the relationship between massacres and the population decline of Tasmanian Aborigines. Using French historical sociologist, Jacques Semelin's typology of massacre, Ryan's seminal case study of the Meander River region in 2008 found that the second phase of the war experienced the highest number of massacres and Aboriginal deaths. She drew the important conclusion that Governor Arthur established an infrastructure whereby settler massacres could be carried out and called for more work to be done on this phase of the war. While Ryan emphasises official discourses as an important component of this infrastructure there is room for further investigation. Utilising Semelin's theorisation of massacre for the period 1826-1828, this thesis traces the development of official and unofficial discourses of violence to demonstrate why there was a turn to massacre within the settler population of Van Diemen's Land. Encompassing both the legal and social dynamics of the settler colony, the study seeks to map out the pathways that enabled military personnel, police magistrates and stock-keepers to take part in the indiscriminate killing of Aborigines. Finally, I will apply Semelin's five-point typology to examine two instances of settler massacres on the Oyster Bay tribe. Situated within a distinct geographical and social context, I will investigate the motivations and methods of these violent episodes to further our understanding of massacre in its Vandemonian context.},

  abstract = {Existing histories of the early temperance movement in New South Wales all adopt broad, structural approaches, constructing explanatory narratives that focus variously on issues of class, social status and secularisation to explain the rise of the movement in the early 1830s and its turn toward total abstinence in the final years of that decade.This thesis examines the writings and reported actions of a key leader in the movement, John Saunders, in order to complement and, where necessary, complicate the already existing histories. What emerges is a case study in the complex interaction between class, status and religious belief within the understandings and motivations that drove the movement, with broader implications for our understanding of religion and secularism in nineteenth-century Australia. While issues of class and social status were undeniably prominent within the rationale and rhetoric of the movement, neither of these factors on its own is sufficient to explain the motivations and behaviour of those involved. Nor does the theory that the early temperance movement was driven by a fundamentally secular ideology of ``moral enlightenment'' allow sufficient room for the multi-layered and carefully-articulated combination of enlightenment ideals and evangelical convictions within the thinking of leaders such as Saunders.},

  shorttitle = {Precarious Printers},
  author = {Stein, J. A.},
  year = {2014},
  abstract = {From 1959 to 1989 the NSW Government Printing Office (hereafter `the Gov') was a government-run printing establishment that operated from a centralised factory in Ultimo, Sydney. Over a 30-year period marked by dramatic technological change and political transitions, the Gov was pulled in conflicting directions by traditionalists, unionists, economic rationalists and those somewhere in between. It was also one of the first Australian factories to open printing apprenticeships to women. This combination \textendash{} technological change, the rising influence of neo-liberal economics and gender-labour tensions \textendash{} made for an unsettled institution. In mid-1989 the state government abruptly closed down the Gov and 700 people lost their jobs. This thesis operates on two levels: it offers both an historical and a methodological contribution to knowledge. At an historical level Precarious Printers is an exploration of how the Gov's workers \textendash{} from labourers to managers \textendash{} coped with technological, social and political change. This has brought to light many aspects of the Gov's culture of working life (everyday practices and unofficial stories) and it indicates the important presence of objects, technologies and spaces as they exist in memories of working life. Two central coping practices are identified: building alliances and unofficial creative production. Firstly, the Gov's employees came to grips with their circumstances by developing alliances with people and/or technologies. This involved staking out territories spatially or by developing their skills. Some workers clung to their skills, traditional tools and collective practices. Others enthusiastically embraced new technologies with an individualistic drive for self-improvement. Secondly, many of the Gov's employees enacted their own narratives \textendash{} of resilience, belonging and of industrial decline \textendash{} through unsanctioned creative practices. This came in the form of photographs, film, pranks and the unofficial production of printed materials (foreign orders). The key theoretical and methodological contribution of this dissertation is a demonstration of how labour history can be effectively drawn together with considerations of material culture. As a case study, the Gov reveals how the politics of work is intertwined with the physical and designed world. This dissertation provides a method for analysing labour, technology and industrial history that retains the voices of the workers and adds a relevant consideration of spaces, objects and embodied experience. Correspondingly, this research draws upon a number of disciplines: labour history, sociology, the history of technology and studies of material culture and design. Primary source materials include oral history, photographs and archives. Rather than simply aestheticising past technologies and industrial spaces, Precarious Printers finds that material culture, technology and spatial dynamics are significant elements in an analysis of working life and in developing an understanding of people's adaptive responses to technological change and workplace upheaval.},

The research was necessary as little is known about the transition of this cohort to a life after sport, or their experiences of retirement. A key problem within the SCT paradigm is a presumption that an end to elite sport requires a process of adjustment that is common to all sportspeople\textemdash a rather narrow perspective that fails to acknowledge the situational complexity and socio-cultural diversity of elite athletes. With such a range of personal circumstances, it is reasonable to suppose that athletes from different cultural groups will have different individual SCT needs. The researcher is non-Indigenous and mature aged: she encountered a number of challenges in her efforts to understand Indigenous culture and its important sensitivities, and to build trust with the Indigenous male participants she interviewed. An Indigenous methodology known as Dadirri, which emphasises deep and respectful listening, guided the development of the research design. Consistent with previous studies conducted by non-Indigenous researchers, an open-ended and conversational approach to interviewing Indigenous respondents was developed. The objective was for the voices of the athletes to be heard, allowing the collection of rich data based on the participants' perspectives about SCT. An overview of the findings is presented, illustrating that Indigenous athletes' experience SCT in complex and distinctive ways. The article provides a model for non-Indigenous researchers to conduct qualitative research with Indigenous people.},

  abstract = {The Audiovisual Documentation of Crimes of Political Violence in Timor-Leste is a research-driven interdisciplinary work that aims, through documentary filmmaking and critical writing, to develop methods for representing the relationship between the past and the present in Timor-Leste. An estimated 204,000 East Timorese died during Indonesia's 24-year occupation of Timor-Leste (Staveteig 2007). Since its independence in 2002, the need to remember victims of the occupation has been expressed in a range of commemorative rituals and memorialisation practices. Moreover, survivor and witness testimony has become central to transitional justice processes, forensic investigations and documentary filmmaking. Despite the impression of a consistent collective narrative, remembrance of the occupation and the resistance is dynamic and complex. A close examination reveals that unfulfilled expectations, shifting allegiances and political priorities have informed both personal testimony and public commemoration. Michael Leach (2008) has observed these `fault lines' in Timor-Leste's official historiography, and Lia Kent (2011) has discussed the tensions between local and state-orchestrated commemoration. Damien Grenfell (2012) has pointed out how remembering the dead reveals an intricate interplay between modern, customary and traditional epistemologies. These writers present a nuanced understanding of remembrance. However, documentary filmmaking about Timor-Leste has rarely addressed this complexity. The written exegesis explores the challenges and benefits of developing alternative documentary approaches to represent the occupation and its legacy in the present day. It reflects on 15 years of filmmaking in Timor-Leste, beginning with a documentary about the formation of this new nation, East Timor \textendash{} Birth of a Nation: Luolo's Story (2002). This work was followed up with a film about an international forensic investigation of the infamous1991 Santa Cruz massacre, Anatomy of a Massacre (2010). Both films are revisited in the light of theoretical and community concerns. Grounded in Timorese perspectives, I address debates about evidence, testimony and memory, and examine how these views informed the making of The Spirits of Tasi Tolu (2016), the documentary that forms part of this thesis. I conclude by arguing for a reflexive, expressive and consultative documentary filmmaking approach that is able to balance divergent understandings of place, death and time.},

In emphasising class identities, experiences and affiliations in specific places, their attention has focused on the integrative pressures that enabled certain groups of workers to mobilise politically and industrially in pursuit of collective interests or that produced 'labour-community coalitions'. By contrast, this paper looks beyond ties of class and place and assumptions about shared interests in order to explore how community came to be associated with consensus and group authority rather than social diversity and division. Instead of focusing on integrative pressures that promote conformity to imposed notions of identity and norms of conduct, it emphasises differentiation by recognising that people have numerous sources of identity and interests and that places are spatially fluid and internally-fragmented. Hence, it points to the need for historians to re-examine the question of individual choice in order to enhance our understanding of precisely how the structural and subjective aspects of community and class relate to each other and the way that individual and group identities cohere and fragment across time and space.},

We distributed surveys to a multinational sample of scientific researchers at two different time periods (October 2009 to July 2010 and October 2013 to March 2014) to observe current states of data sharing and to see what, if any, changes have occurred in the past 3\textendash 4 years. We also looked at differences across age, geographic, and discipline-based groups as they currently exist in the 2013/2014 survey. Results point to increased acceptance of and willingness to engage in data sharing, as well as an increase in actual data sharing behaviors. However, there is also increased perceived risk associated with data sharing, and specific barriers to data sharing persist. There are also differences across age groups, with younger respondents feeling more favorably toward data sharing and reuse, yet making less of their data available than older respondents. Geographic differences exist as well, which can in part be understood in terms of collectivist and individualist cultural differences. An examination of subject disciplines shows that the constraints and enablers of data sharing and reuse manifest differently across disciplines. Implications of these findings include the continued need to build infrastructure that promotes data sharing while recognizing the needs of different research communities. Moving into the future, organizations such as DataONE will continue to assess, monitor, educate, and provide the infrastructure necessary to support such complex grand science challenges.}

He was of Irish Catholic background and three areas dominated his life in Australia - the Catholic Church, his medical career, and his passion for Italy. He published numerous medical articles, commentary pieces and three memoir-inspired books in which he represents and justifies his life experiences and actions. Narrative identity is the theoretical approach used to investigate and illustrate how Moran presented himself biographically, and how he represented his experiences and his actions in his publications. His values and beliefs, as well as his thoughts about himself, and other aspects of his life are examined in a way that enhances our knowledge of inter-war history. Moran's works shine a light on Australia's past in a time of flux and the social change resulting from World War 1. They show the impact of these social changes on the life of Moran, and the people around him.},

  abstract = {Since the early 1990s, a large body of literature has studied high profile controversies in museums. These scholars have called on museums not to hide from controversy, but rather view controversy as a productive aspect of contemporary museology. Their case is founded on transforming the role of museums - by discarding their associations with tradition and, instead, taking a stand on politically contentious subject matter. But in reality, museums face many social and political pressures that prevent them from fully rallying behind this call. Moreover, to date scholars have overlooked investigating if there are legitimate reasons behind this trend of reluctance or cautiousness. This study aims to fill this analytical gap by asking why museums struggle to take a stand on politically contentious subject matter following a controversy. In its attempt to do so this thesis narrows its analysis to a case study of the National Museum of Australia (NMA). It provides a window into a previously unexamined area - how NMA staff dealt with politically contentious subject matter during its ten-year (2003-2013) refurbishment project and cultural policy debates, after its involvement in the Australian version of the history wars. Analysis of public and grey material, interviews, media clips, and final gallery exhibits illuminates the strategies deployed by NMA staff during: the refurbishment of a gallery exploring transnational history ('Australian Journeys: Australia's Connections with the World'), a gallery presenting a general history of Australia since 1788 ('Landmarks: People and Places Across Australia/), and two unique opportunities to debate cultural policy with federal politicians (Senate Estimates hearings on the efficiency dividend and consultations on 'Creative Australia: National Cultural Policy, 2013-2023'). The analysis is located within interdisciplinary work - including sociology, organisational theory, museum studies, cultural politics, and Australian history - that critiques organisational crises and change. I argue that the ability of museum managers and curators to earn credibility and trust was problematic and complex during the refurbishment project and the cultural policy opportunities. Following its earlier controversy, NMA staff were faced with addressing a complex tension - between professional, scholarly, and social responsibility considerations and garnering credibility with powerful stakeholders. NMA staff tailored their strategies across two phases, which had a largely constraining impact on curatorial and interpretative practices. Out of necessity I contend that NMA staff prioritised rebuilding trust and belief, or what I call credibility in my study. During the first phase (2003-2009), staff made compromises in order to restore trust with stakeholders with opposing political agendas. During the second phase (2006-2013), which overlaps with the phase, the NMA struggled to garner credibility with socially liberal stakeholders who acted with ambivalence towards the refurbishments and during cultural policy debates. The study's findings illustrate that the NMA took a more conservative approach than that advocated by much existing scholarly work. It asserts that restoring credibility is a genuine consideration for museums following a controversy. While museums may have to make compromises, the study finds that crises are never wasted effort. This study is not suggesting major museums in Australia avoid provoking controversy with powerful stakeholders. Rather, it acknowledges the worthwhile but considerable task ahead for museums recovering from crises and pursuing reforms that magnify divisive views within Australian society.},

  abstract = {The management of Aboriginal cultural heritage in intensively settled and farmed regions of Australia faces legal and ethical challenges. This study examines how fifteen farmers from the Tatiara District of South Australia perceive Aboriginal Cultural Resources (ACR) and Aboriginal Cultural Heritage (ACH) on their freehold farmland. Drawing on the concept of cultural heritage as a cultural process, the thesis employs an Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) methodology to interpret the findings of detailed interviews which explored the perspectives of farmer stakeholders and the way ACR and ACH is managed in farming contexts. Previous research on Aboriginal heritage has focused on the interests and perspectives of Aboriginal, professional and government stakeholders. However, in terms of effective management of ACR and ACH in farming landscapes, a pivotal `first step' is understanding the points of view of the farmers on whose land the ACR resides: how Aboriginal heritage fits within the `lived life' of agriculture; what farmers know of South Australian Aboriginal cultural heritage protection legislation and administration; and how they understand the protection of ACR and ACH on their farms. This thesis finds that, despite uncertain understandings of cultural heritage, Tatiara farmers have a positive attitude toward protecting and preserving ACR. However, a marginalisation of farmers in Aboriginal heritage management leaves them feeling ignorant, incompetent, vulnerable and reluctant to engage and deal with Aboriginal issues. These findings highlight the significance of including all stakeholders in cultural heritage management regimes and of facilitating dialogue between farmers and those Aboriginal communities for whom the cultural resources on farms have the potential to become heritage. Stakeholder cooperation and collaboration is particularly necessary in circumstances where cultural resources are divorced from cultural knowledge, control and ownership. The results of this study suggest that efficacious Aboriginal heritage management in cross-cultural situations rests on an investment in the capacity of non-Aboriginal stakeholders to engage with Aboriginal cultures and heritage, and for Aboriginal people to engage with `known' and `unknown' ACR with the potential to become ACH. The conclusion of this study is that worthwhile Aboriginal heritage management will likely emanate from mutual respectful, trusting relationships, developed in local ethical spaces supporting stakeholder cross-cultural communication, negotiation and collaboration.},

The process of representing industry in museums during a period of significant economic change was highly contested. Whilst political and economic leaders often expressed a desire to vanquish the ?old black industrial image?, there was a growing popular concern to venerate and represent an industrial culture and landscape that appeared under threat. At the same time the curation of industrial heritage, with its focus on collective memory, associational life and culture, represented a clear break with an earlier regional museum inheritance characterised by singular philanthropic and antiquarian collections and institutional developments. After 1960, the creation of museums to represent coalmining brought these tensions and new agendas to the fore. This article suggests that by examining in detail the historical context in which they were created we can better understand the nuanced and complex process of musealisation and its relationship to the experience of economic change and deindustrialisation.}

Unsettling given notions of species, it explores a broad terrain of possible modes of classifying, categorizing, and paying attention to the diverse ways of life that constitute worlds. From detailed attention to particular entities, a multiplicity of possible connection and understanding opens up: species are always multiple, multiplying their forms and associations. It is this coming together of questions of kinds and their multiplicities that characterizes multispecies studies. A range of approaches to knowing and understanding others\textemdash modes of immersion\textemdash ground and guide this research: engagements and collaborations with scientists, farmers, hunters, indigenous peoples, activists, and artists are catalyzing new forms of ethnographic and ethological inquiry. This article also explores the broader theoretical context of multispecies studies, asking what is at stake\textemdash epistemologically, politically, ethically\textemdash in learning to be attentive to diverse ways of life. Are all lively entities biological, or might a tornado, a stone, or a volcano be amenable to similar forms of immersion? What does it mean to live with others in entangled worlds of contingency and uncertainty? More fundamentally, how can we do the work of inhabiting and coconstituting worlds well? In taking up these questions, this article explores the cultivation of ``arts of attentiveness'': modes of both paying attention to others and crafting meaningful response.}

  author = {Van Heekeren, Margaret},
  year = {2012},
  address = {{Sydney, Australia}},
  abstract = {This thesis argues that journalism has been neglected as a major source in researching histories of ideas and public intellectualism in Australia. It responds to calls by historians for a close examination of journalism and undertakes an extensive survey of articles from 1885 to 1945 in the Sydney Morning Herald, Daily Telegraph, Adelaide Advertiser and Register newspapers and transcripts of Australian Broadcasting Commission talks programs. The study focuses on one form of philosophical and political thought, New Idealism, which has received little detailed academic attention in Australia. New Idealism, also known as British Idealism, was a philosophical movement of the mid to late nineteenth century and first half of the twentieth century that migrated to Australia with the former students of the British philosophers T. H. Green (1836 \textendash{} 1882) and Edward Caird (1835 \textendash{} 1908). New Idealism was very much a practical philosophy and its followers were just as likely to be found in public lecture halls and on school boards as in university offices. In Australia this public face of New Idealism extended to the media. The thesis identifies a considerable body of previously unknown work in newspaper articles and radio broadcasts by five Australian Idealist thinkers: William Jethro Brown (1869-1930); Francis Anderson (1858 \textendash{} 1941); Mungo MacCallum (1854-1942); Garnet Vere Portus (1883 \textendash{} 1954) and Ernest Burgmann (1885 \textendash{} 1967). Four areas of thought as revealed in the media are examined: on education; the role of the state; international relations and war and post-war reconstruction. The thesis finds a sympathetic media, particularly the Sydney Morning Herald under the proprietorship of the Fairfax family, facilitated coverage of these debates and enabled the Australian Idealists to have, at times, considerable influence as public intellectuals. This leads to a conclusion that an historical focus on the journalistic report is a highly successful research approach in intellectual history.},

  abstract = {This thesis provides an analysis of post-Second World War employment policy in Australia. Specific focus is paid to the post-war system (1946 to 1975) and the neoliberal system (1975 to the present), the theoretical underpinnings of these systems, and how these manifest in employment policy. The post-war system is first analysed and shown to have a positive employment record, buffered by the full employment commitment of the state. The breakdown of the post-war system during the Whitlam years, signalled by the abandonment of full employment, was driven by institutional and political forces that gained support during the 1970s crisis of stagflation. This was further entrenched by the Fraser government. The neoliberalisation of Australian employment policy during the Hawke-Keating years is then discussed, a period in which Australia underwent significant economic reform, culminating in limited jobs programs for the early 1990s recession. The Howard government further entrenched the neoliberalisation of Australian employment policy through the quasi-marketisation of employment services, and attacks on labour and unions. Finally, it is shown that the expansionary response of the Rudd government to the GFC, while providing a boost to employment, did not challenge the neoliberal system.},

  abstract = {In 1939 some 200 Aboriginal people walked off the Cummeragunja Station on the NSW-Victoria border in protest over decades of mistreatment and abuse at the hands of the NSW Protection bureaucracy. Aboriginal protest was not new by the late 1930s but the social and political landscape had significantly shifted. In particular the media was more receptive, the white supporters of the Aborigines had grown in numbers and the Aboriginal political presence had grown in size, range and force. Not only did the protesters take the novel approach of crossing the Murray River from NSW and camping on the other side, they developed considerable momentum, utilising the media to spread the word, and marshalled significant support from cross-sections of the community at large. Although the bureaucracy was successful in ending the protest, it was a pyrrhic victory and confronted them with a choice: they could either pursue the responses of old or adapt to maintain control in the new political landscape. By exploring these disparate forces, this thesis argues that the Cummeragunja walk-off was a particular kind of protest at a particular point in time. In the end it did not achieve what the protesters hoped it would. However, it helped to shift the Australian conscience on Indigenous issues and created a strong Indigenous legacy lasting to this day.},

  abstract = {After decades of sub-disciplines that have moved away from grand narratives and long-term trends, some of Australia's leading historians are now embracing frameworks that look beyond traditional history in big ways: through the geological concept of 'deep time', historians can place narratives within deeper histories of the human species, the earth, and even the universe. This interest in deep history has not been limited to academia, with a similar explosion in public interest around Australia's deep human past and its potential to re-shape national narratives. At the heart of deep time in Australia is Mungo Man: the 50,000-year-old Pleistocene skeleton found in 1974. Yet, despite his prominent role in both academic history and public discussion, there has been no examinationof Mungo Man's image and narrative function. This study seeks to unpack the representations of Mungo Man in history and public discourse. How is Mungo Man represented by academics and the general public? How have these representations varied since his discovery in 1974? And why is it only now that he has begun to be integrated into historical research and public discussion? This study will provide essential context on the recent surge of interest in Mungo Man, deep time, and the powerful resonance they lend Australian history today and in the future.},

  abstract = {This thesis investigates how Anzac narratives are interpreted and integrated into contemporary understandings of Australian national heritage and collective remembering through craft. The Anzac Centenary commemorative efforts have been positioned as a focal point of national significance for Australia in the period 2014-2018, and encompass the keystone centenary of the Anzac troops landing at Gallipoli in 1915. Social narratives on the Centenary have tended to be institutionally controlled and homogeneous, and commemorative activities have been tied closely to the traditional spheres of commemoration, such as services and marches. This thesis focuses attention on vernacular, individual-level acts of Anzac commemoration that took place outside of these contexts to understand how everyday Australians were moved by and respond to the call to remember the Anzac Centenary. Grounded in a material and cultural studies approach, I critically examine the milieu of production of Anzac-themed arts and crafts artefacts created specifically for rural agricultural shows and arts and craft displays. Interviews with 34 creative artists, readings of created Anzac cultural artefacts (entries or displays), and consideration of the display sites themselves were all analysed to draw attention to the inherent purposes, meanings and assumptions of the Anzac narrative operating in these contexts. My analysis unmasks the 'cultural work' that is undertaken through commemoration in non-traditional locations. Firstly, I found that crafty commemoration is a meaningful endeavour, achieved through identity affirmation around family or craft practice, and building a sense of belong to community and nation. Secondly, crafty commemorations reproduce and reinforce traditional imagery and emotional frameworks associated with Anzac that in turn support a crafty commemoration as a palatable, accessible and non-threatening form of commemoration. Finally, I found that the contexts of production and display of crafty commemoration may frequently be banal, which contributes to the normalisation of Anzac narrative as a widely accepted element of social life. Overall, I argue that the process and creative interpretations of Anzac do not necessarily constitute active dissent or rejection of the nationalist discourse; rather, they increase the spaces into which the Anzac discourse permeates, further solidifying its place in the national consciousness.},

  abstract = {Twentieth century writers have generally condemned the harshness of the convict administrations of a number of the Commandants during both the First (1788-1814) and Second (1825-1855) Settlements of Norfolk Island. On the other hand, several Commandants have also received unwarranted praise for their efforts to improve the lot of the convicts under their control. Some of these views have relied on questionable or biased writings, which are not supported by the surviving official records. This thesis considers some of the environmental factors and events that affected the Commandants. After examining the significant features of their periods of service on Norfolk Island, it is evident that historians have unfairly treated a number of these officers. The severity of convict life on the Island during the Second Settlement has been exaggerated; the regime of corporal punishment has been dramatized and was in fact less severe than that applied during the First Settlement, which was not planned as a place for secondary punishment. Again, for example, there is no support for the view that during the Second Settlement the convicts welcomed death to relieve them of their sufferings on Norfolk Island. In the 19th century, a significant proportion of the informative literature about the convict settlements on Norfolk Island, and particularly the Second Settlement, was written by individuals who wished to promote their own agendas for change. Supporters of concepts such as prison reform, opposition to transportation, the elimination of assignment to private masters, and moral reform in the colony of New south Wales, provided exaggerated pictures of life on Norfolk Island. The misrepresentation of the Commandants is attributed to the survival and promotion of these often-skewed writings that yielded copy for imaginative, fictional narratives about the convict years.},

  abstract = {Research into science communication has included books, newspapers, television and radio analysis but no-one has studied science on postage stamps as a communication medium. Yet stamps incorporate a literate and a visual communication message that governments have used to elucidate ideological ideals and policies, for civic education, for nation building and to advise on matters of public health. Within every stamp image is a permanent record that preserves that message information from the date of issue through many generations. This thesis examines the multiple science message roles the stamp has carried from ten representative countries since the first use of the medium. It explores paths and into how and why a country visualises and publicises its place locally and to the outside world. The taxonomy developed is applicable to other disciplines in describing classification of communication themes. 'Science' as represented on postage stamps defines the state of science and technology at a set point in time, the date of issue, and provides a commentary on society and a set of activities, functions or needs. A case study methodology has been used provide examples of the many roles of the stamp message. Half of all science stamps show the science as its main image generally accompanied by a textual description explaining the reason for issue at that particular time. The other half of all science stamps depend upon a named scientist as the focal point of the message. Events and anniversaries are the prompts for many issues. Government's hand is shown when the message is political, is nation-building and often in advising of public health issues. The nature of the image has evolved with time, which time can be related to the development of science communication when science has fragmented and is an increasingly specialist endeavour undertaken by institutions. This study analyses how, through stamp issue, the current perspective of science is shown by the context in step with the movement understood as the public understanding of science evolving into the public awareness of science.},

However, this fascination goes beyond the side of a highway and enters the realm of tourism.  Today, numerous sites of death and disaster attract millions of visitors from all around the world: Auschwitz-Birkenau, Anne Frank's House, Graceland, Oklahoma City, Gettysburg, Vimy Ridge, the Somme, Arlington National Cemetery.  The list grows each year as exhibited by the recent creation of an apartheid museum in Johannesburg, South Africa.  Due to the increasing popularity of this tourism product, a small number of academics have begun studying the phenomenon. Leading the field are Lennon and Foley who labeled it Dark Tourism, Seaton who coined the term Thanatourism, and Rojek who developed the concept of Black Spots. However, despite ongoing study, there has been a paucity in understanding what actually motivates individuals to sites of dark tourism. Yet understanding motivation is imperative, particularly given the subject and sensitivity of these sites.  Some are slowly decaying, and visitors play a large role in their preservation. Subsequently, without proper management, visitor influxes can further deteriorate sites or induce friction with the locals. Knowledge then, also provides administrators the necessary tools to properly manage the varying stakeholders. Although many feel an interest in death and disaster simply stems from morbidity, the range of factors involved extend from an interest in history and heritage to education to remembrance. To begin this study, a list of possible motivations was compiled. Then, to get a better comprehension of these motivations, visitors to the Holocaust Museum Houston were surveyed as a case study. As a commodified, synthetic site of death and atrocity, the museum fits the definitions of a dark tourism site as established by lead academics. Therefore, by asking visitors to the museum what motivated them to the site, the results will hopefully give some acumen into the wants and needs of certain stakeholders. Finally, this research sought to discover if motivation at the museum could shed light on motivation to other sites of dark tourism.},

  abstract = {This remarkable book is about everything from echidnas to evolution, cosmology to cooking, sex and science and spirits to Schrodinger's cat. Tyson Yunkaporta looks at global systems from an Indigenous perspective. He asks how contemporary life diverges from the pattern of creation. How does this affect us? How can we do things differently? Sand Talk provides a template for living. It's about how lines and symbols and shapes can help us make sense of the world. It's about how we learn and how we remember. It's about talking to everybody and listening carefully. It's about finding different ways to look at things. Most of all it's about Indigenous thinking, and how it can save the world},
